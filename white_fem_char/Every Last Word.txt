I shouldn't be reading the notes.
Hailey trims a rose and passes it to me. As I attach the
note to the stem with sparkly pink ribbon, I read it. I can't
help it. This one's a little over-the-top, but it's still sweet. I
give it to Olivia and she drops it in the classroom-specific
bucket.
“No way! You guys…” Olivia snorts, laughing hard as she
turns the card over in her hand. I guess she's reading them,
too. “I can't tell who wrote this but…poor boy. This is so
cheesy.”
Someone's attempt at heartfelt poetry makes its way
around the circle. Alexis falls back against my bed in
hysterics. Kaitlyn and Hailey double over on my rug.
Eventually, I join in.
“This is mean. Let's not read them,” I say, hiding the rose
in the middle of the bucket, wanting to protect this
anonymous guy who put his heart on the line for some girl
in his calculus class named Jessica.
Olivia grabs the stack of cards in front of me and starts
thumbing through them. “God, who are these people and
how do we not know any of them?”
“We're not losers?” Alexis offers.
“It's a big school,” Hailey counters.
“Okay, back to work. The flowers are wilting.” Kaitlyn's
still laughing as she snaps back to her role as the leader of
our Valentine's Day fundraiser. “Olivia, since you like the
notes so much, switch places with Samantha.”
Olivia shakes her head, and her ponytail goes flying. “No
way. I like my job.”
“I'll switch. My hand's getting tired anyway,” Hailey says,
and the two of us trade spots.
I grab a rose out of the bucket and pick the scissors up
off the floor. The instant I slide my fingers through the
handles, this thought hits me out of nowhere, and before I
have time to react I feel my brain sink its teeth in and latch
on tight, already preparing to fight me for it. My hand starts
trembling and my mouth goes dry.
It's just a thought.
I let the scissors fall to the floor and I shake out my
hands a few times, looking around the circle to be sure no
one's watching me.
I'm in control.
I try again. Rose in one hand, scissors in the other, I
squeeze my fingers together, but my palms feel clammy
and my fingers are tingling and I can't get a solid grip. I look
up at Kaitlyn, sitting directly across from me, watching her
face twist and blur as a wave of nausea passes over me.
Breathe. Find a new thought.
If I cut it once, I'll keep going. I know I will. I'll move on to
the next rose, and the next one, and I'll keep cutting until
there's nothing left but a huge pile of stems, leaves, and
petals.
After that, I'll massacre those syrupy sweet, carefully
written notes. Every single one of them.
God, that's so twisted.
Then I'll take the scissors to Olivia's ponytail and cut
right through that hair tie.
Shit. New thought. New thought.
“I need a glass of water,” I say, standing and hoping
none of them notice the sweat beading up on my forehead.
“Now?” Kaitlyn asks. “Come on, Samantha, you'll hold
everything up.”
My legs are wobbly and I'm not sure I can trust them to
get me downstairs, but somehow the scissors are gone and
the banister is in my hand instead. I head straight into the
kitchen and run my hands under the water.
The water is cold. Listen to the water.
“Are you okay?” Paige's voice breaks through the chatter
in my head. I hadn't even seen my little sister sitting at the
counter, doing her homework. That's when I spot the knife
block, full of knives. And a pair of scissors.
I could slice right through her hair.
I take big steps backward until I slam into the
refrigerator. My knees give out and I slide down to the floor,
gripping the sides of my head, burying my face in my hands
to make it dark, repeating the mantras.
“Sam. Open your eyes.” Mom's voice sounds far away,
but I obey her words, and when I do, the two of us are nose
to nose. “Talk to me. Now.”
I look over at the staircase, wide-eyed.
“Don't worry,” she says. “They won't find out. They're
upstairs.”
I hear Mom whispering to Paige, telling her to take a bag
of chips up to my room and keep my friends distracted.
Then she grabs both of my hands so hard, her wedding
ring digs into one of my knuckles. “They're just thoughts,”
she says calmly. “Say it, please.”
“They're just thoughts.” I can echo her words but not the
steadiness in her voice.
“Good. You're in control.” When I look away from her she
grips my arms harder.
“I'm in control.”
She's wrong. I'm not.
“How many thoughts does the brain automatically deliver
in a single day?” Mom moves on to facts to help me center
myself.
“Seventy thousand,” I whisper as tears splash onto my
jeans.
“That's right. Do you act on seventy thousand thoughts a
day?”
I shake my head.
“Of course you don't. This thought was one in seventy
thousand. It's not special.”
“It's not special.”
“Good.” Mom pinches my chin and lifts my head, forcing
me to look at her again. “I love you, Sam.” She smells like
her favorite lavender-scented lotion, and I inhale it, feeling a
host of newer, prettier thoughts overpowering the darker,
scarier ones. “Whatever you're thinking, it's okay. It doesn't
mean anything about you. Got it? Now tell me.”
The two of us have been here before. It hasn't happened
in a long time, not like this, but Mom slips right into her
assigned role as if it's second nature. She's well trained.
“Scissors,” I whisper, dropping my head to my chest,
feeling dirty and sick and humiliated. I hate telling her these
awful thoughts, but I hate the thought spiral even more, and
this is my ticket out. I'm well trained, too.
“The roses. Olivia's hair and…Paige…” Mom doesn't
make me finish. She wraps her arms around me and I grab
ahold of her T-shirt, sobbing into her shoulder, telling her
I'm sorry.
“You have nothing to be sorry for.” She pulls away and
kisses my forehead. “Now stay here. I'll be right back.”
“Please don't,” I beg, but I know she won't listen. She's
doing what she has to do. I dig my fingernails into the back
of my neck three times, over and over again until she
returns. When I look up, she's crouched down in front of me
again, holding the scissors flat in her hand.
“Take them, please.”
I don't want to touch them, but I don't have a choice. My
fingertip connects with the cold metal and I let it slide over
the blade, lightly, slowly, just tickling the surface. When I
feel the handle, I curl my fingers through the holes. Mom's
hair is dangling in my face.
I could cut it. But I would never do that.
“Good. It's just a pair of scissors. They triggered a few
scary thoughts, but you won't act on them because you,
Samantha McAllister, are a good person.” Her voice sounds
closer now.
I drop the scissors on the floor and give them a hard push
to get them as far away from me as possible. I throw my
arms around Mom's shoulders, hugging her hard, hoping
this is the last time we go through this but knowing it isn't.
The anxiety attacks are like earthquakes. I'm always
relieved when the ground stops shaking, but I know there
will be another one eventually, and again, I'll never see it
coming.
“What am I going to tell them?”
My friends can't know about my OCD or the debilitating,
uncontrollable thoughts, because my friends are normal.
And perfect. They pride themselves on normalcy and
perfection, and they can't ever find out how far I am from
those two things.
“Paige is sitting in for you on rose duty. The girls think
you're helping me with something in the kitchen.” Mom
hands me a dish towel so I can clean myself up. “Go back
upstairs whenever you're ready.”
I sit alone for a long time, taking deep breaths. I still
can't look at the scissors on the far end of the kitchen floor,
and I'm pretty sure Mom will hide all the sharp objects for
the next few days, but I'm okay now.
Still, I can hear this one thought hiding in the dark
corners of my mind. It doesn't attack like the others, but it's
frightening in a totally different way. Because it's the one
that never leaves. And it's the one that scares me most.
What if I'm crazy?

Lane three. It's always lane number three. My coaches
think it's funny. Quirky. A thing, like not washing your lucky
socks or growing a rally beard. And that's perfect. That's all
I want them to know.
I step up to the top of the block and twist at the waist,
shaking out my arms and legs. Squeezing my toes tight
around the edge, I look down at the water and run both
thumbs over the block's scratchy tape three times.
“Swimmers, take your marks.” Coach Kevin's voice
echoes off the clubhouse walls at the far end of the pool,
and when he blows his whistle, my body's response is purely
Pavlovian. Palm over hand, my elbows lock as I press my
arms into my ears and throw myself forward, stretching and
reaching and holding the position until my fingertips slice
through the surface.
And then, for ten blissful seconds, there's no noise at all
except the sound of water whooshing past my ears.
I kick hard and lock in my song. The first one that pops
into my head is a happy tune with catchy lyrics, so I start
my butterfly stroke, throwing both arms over my head in
perfect synchronization with the beat. Kick, kick, throw. Kick,
kick, throw. One, two, three.
Before I know it I'm touching the opposite end of the
pool, doing a tight turn, and pushing hard off the wall. I
don't look up or left or right. As coach says, right now, at
this moment in the race, no one matters but you.
My head leaves the water every few seconds, and when
it does, I can hear the coaches screaming at us to get our
chins down or our hips up, to straighten our legs or arch our
backs. I don't hear my name, but I check myself anyway.
Today, everything feels right. I feel right. And fast. I increase
the tempo of the song and kick it into gear for the last few
strokes, and when my fingertips connect with the edge of
the pool, I pop up and steal a glance at the clock. I shaved
four-tenths of a second off my best time.
I'm breathing hard as Cassidy gives me a fist bump from
lane four and says, “Damn…you're gonna slaughter me at
county this weekend.” She's won the county championship
three years in a row. I'll never beat her, and I know she's
just being nice, but it feels good to hear her say it anyway.
The whistle blows again and someone dives off the block
above me, signaling my turn to exit. I pull myself up out of
the water, peeling off my swim cap as I head for my towel.
“Whoa! Where on earth did that come from?” When I
look up, I'm eye to eye with Brandon. Or, more accurately,
eye to chest with Brandon. I force myself to keep looking up,
past his thin T-shirt and to his eyes, even though the
temptation to check out the way his shorts hug his hips is
almost more than I can resist.
During my first summer at the club, Brandon was just an
older teammate with an insanely fast freestyle who always
put up the most points in meets and taught the little kids to
swim. But for the last two summers he's returned from
college as a junior coach—my coach—and that makes him
strictly off-limits. And even hotter.
“Thanks.” I'm still trying to catch my breath. “I guess I
just found a good rhythm.”
Brandon shows me his perfect teeth, and those crinkles
next to his eyes are even more pronounced. “Would you do
that again at county, please?”
I try to come up with a funny comeback, something that
will keep him smiling at me like this, but instead my cheeks
get hot while he stares at me, waiting for me to reply. I look
at the ground, chastising myself for my lack of creativity
while I watch the water drip from my suit, forming a puddle
underneath my feet.
Brandon must follow my gaze because he suddenly
gestures at the row of towels strewn across the wall behind
him and says, “Stay there. Don't move.”
A few seconds later he's back. “Here.” He wraps a towel
around my shoulders and slides it back and forth a few
times, and I wait for him to drop the ends, but he doesn't. I
look up at his eyes and realize he's staring at me. Like…
maybe he wants to kiss me. And I know I'm looking at him
like I want him to, because I do. It's all I think about.
His eyes are still locked on mine, but I know he'll never
make the first move, so I take one brave step forward, then
another, and without overthinking what I'm about to do, I
press my dripping wet suit against his T-shirt, feeling the
water soak it through to his skin.
He lets out a breath as he balls the ends of the towel in
his fists and uses it to pull me even closer. My hands leave
his hips and find his back, and I feel his muscles tense
beneath my palms as he tips his head down and kisses me.
Hard. And then he pulls on my towel again.
His mouth is warm and he parts his lips, and oh my God,
this is finally happening, and even though there are people
everywhere and I keep hearing the whistle blow and the
coaches calling out behind me, I don't care, because right
now I just want to—
“Sam? You okay?” I blink fast and shake my head as
Brandon releases the towel and I feel it fall slack at my
sides. “Where'd you go, kid?”
He's still standing two steps away and not even the
slightest bit damp. And I'm not a kid. I'm sixteen. He's only
nineteen. It's not that different. He adjusts his baseball cap
and gives me that ridiculously adorable smile of his. “I
thought I lost you for a second there.”
“No.” You did the exact opposite of losing me. My chest
feels heavy as the fantasy floats up into the air and
disappears from sight. “I was just thinking about
something.”
“I bet I know.”
“You do?”
“Yeah. And you have nothing to worry about. Push
yourself like that at county and keep swimming year-round,
and you'll have your choice of college scholarships.” He
starts to say something else, but Coach Kevin yells for
everyone to take a spot on the wall. Brandon gives me a
chummy pat on the shoulder. A coachlike pat. “I know how
badly you want this, Sam.”
“More than you could possibly understand.” He's still two
steps away. I wonder what would happen if I really opened
up my towel and wrapped him up in it.
“Sam. Wall!” Coach Kevin yells. He points at the rest of
the team, already gathered and staring at me. I squeeze in
next to Cassidy, and when Coach is out of earshot, she
elbows me and whispers, “Okay, that was cute. That thing
with the towel.”
“Wasn't it?” I shoot her a surprised look. At the beginning
of the summer, Cassidy called him “Coach Crush,” but over
the last few weeks she's become increasingly irritated with
me for not giving up.
“I said it was cute, not that it means anything.”
“Maybe it does.”
“Sam. Sweetie. Really. It doesn't. He grabbed your towel
and dried you off a bit. But that's it. Because he has a
girlfriend. In college.”
“So?” I lean forward, trying not to make it obvious that
I'm looking for him. He's over by the office, drinking a soda
and talking with one of the lifeguards.
“So. He has a girlfriend. In college,” she repeats,
stressing the last word. “He talks about her all the time, and
it's obvious to everyone except you that he's totally in love
with her.”
“Ouch.”
“Sorry. It had to be done.” Cassidy piles her long red hair
on top of her head in a messy bun and then grips my arm
with both hands. “I'm not telling you anything you don't
already know.” She comes in closer. “Look around, Sam,”
she says, gesturing to a long line of our teammates. “There
are plenty of fish in the fancy-private-swim-club sea.”
I look around and see boys in tight Speedos with solid
abs and muscular arms, their skin tanned by the Northern
California sun, their bodies lean and solid after three months
in the water, but none of them are anywhere near as
flawless as Brandon. Even if I did find one of them remotely
attractive, what's the point now? Summer's nearly over.
Cassidy tilts her head to one side, pouting dramatically.
She brings her fingertip to my nose and sighs. “What am I
going to do without you, Sam?”
My stomach clenches into a tight fist as she voices a
thought that's been haunting me since the first day of
August. Like all my summer friends, Cassidy has never
known me outside the pool. She has no idea who I am when
I'm not here, so she doesn't know how backward she has it.
“You'll be fine,” I say, because it's true. Me? I'm not so
sure.
My psychiatrist nailed it back in June, when I practically
floated into her office and announced that I'd taken my last
final. She strode over to the minifridge, poured sparkling
apple cider into two plastic champagne flutes, and said, “To
the triumphant return of Summer Sam” as we clinked
glasses.
But it's coming to an end. In two weeks, I'll be back in
school, Cassidy will be in L.A., and Brandon will be at
college. I'll be missing them, along with my early morning
dives into lane number three.
I'll be Samantha again. And more than anything, I'll be
missing Sam.
“You look fantastic,” Mom says as I step into the kitchen.
I'd better. I spent the last hour putting myself together
for the first day of school. I left my hair down and ironed it
straight. I'm wearing a sheer top over a white camisole,
skinny jeans, and the wedges I begged Mom to buy me. My
eyes are lined, my lips defined, and my foundation is
effectively masking the stress-induced breakout on my chin.
“Thank you.” I hug her tight, hoping she knows I'm not
thanking her for the compliment alone. It's for everything
she's done for me this summer. For coming to all my swim
meets and cheering so loudly, she's hoarse every Sunday
night. It's for all those late-night talks, especially over the
last week when Cassidy left for L.A., Brandon went back to
the East Coast, and the first day of school began to loom
over me like an ominous storm cloud.
Mom's wearing that encouraging smile she always
plasters on when she knows I'm nervous. “Stop looking at
me like that, please,” I say, fighting the urge to roll my eyes.
“I'm fine. Really.”
My cell phone chirps and I pull it from my pocket to check
the screen. “Alexis wants a ride to school today.”
“Why?” Mom asks as she fills a bowl with cereal for
Paige. “She knows it's against the law to drive with
passengers in your first year.” Of course Alexis knows the
law, she's just surprised I'm following it since most people
don't.
I text her back, telling her I can't give her a ride because
if my parents found out, I'd lose my car. I hit SEND and flip
the phone around so Mom can read the screen. She gives an
approving nod.
I shove the phone back in my pocket and hitch my
backpack over my shoulder. “Have a good day, sixth
grader,” I say to Paige as she spoons a big bite of cereal into
her mouth.
As I head for the garage, I'm still texting back and forth
with Alexis, who's begging me to change my mind. I finally
drop the phone into the cup holder as I pull out of the
driveway, ending the discussion without ever telling her the
real reason I won't pick her up today. Or any time in the
near future.
Earlier this month, on my sixteenth birthday, Dad took
me to the DMV to get my license, and when we got home a
few hours later, there was a used Honda Civic parked in our
garage. It was totally unexpected, and it meant so much
more than regular transportation to me. It meant Mom, Dad,
and my psychiatrist thought I could handle it.
I was dying to show off my new car, but Alexis, Kaitlyn,
Olivia, and Hailey were all out of town on their respective
family vacations, and Cassidy was grounded, so I just drove
around by myself for the rest of the afternoon listening to
music and enjoying how the steering wheel felt in my hands.
But every once in a while, I'd glance down at the
odometer, fascinated by the way the numbers changed. I
felt this strange charge whenever the last digit hit the
number three.
When I finally pulled into the driveway that evening, the
last digit was resting on a six, so I backed out again and
drove around the block a few times until the odometer
stopped where it belonged. And now I have to do that every
time I park. I'm not about to let Alexis and the rest of my
friends in on my secret, so I'm happy to have the law as an
excuse to drive alone.
As I pull into the student lot, the odometer is on nine, so I
have to drive all the way to the far end by the tennis courts
before I can park on a three. As I cut the ignition, my
stomach turns over violently and my mouth feels dry, so I sit
there for a minute taking deep breaths.
It's a new year. A fresh start.
The anxiety eases as I walk through campus. Avery
Peterson squeals when she sees me. We hug and promise to
catch up later, and then she returns to Dylan O'Keefe and
grabs his hand.
He was my obsession for the first three months of
freshman year, starting when he asked me to the
homecoming dance and ending when Nick Adler kissed me
at a New Year's Eve party a few months later and promptly
replaced him.
A few steps later, I spot Tyler Riola sitting with his
lacrosse buddies at a table on the far end of the quad. He
had my undivided attention for the first part of sophomore
year, until I started dating Kurt Frasier, the only guy who
wasn't a one-sided fixation. I liked Kurt. A lot. And he
actually liked me back, at least for a few months.
Kurt was hard for me to shake, but Brandon finally took
center stage in my mind when summer started. I picture
him in his Speedo and, as I turn the corner, I wonder what
he's doing right now.
I stop short. That can't be my locker.
The door is wrapped in bright blue paper and there's a
giant silver bow tied around the middle. I run my hand
across it. I can't believe they did this.
I glance up just in time to see the crowd part for Alexis.
As usual, she looks like she just stepped off the cover of
Teen Vogue, with her long blond hair, striking green eyes,
and perfect skin. I can hear her high heels tapping on the
concrete as her designer sundress swings with each step.
She's holding a giant cupcake with purple and white
frosting.
Kaitlyn is on her right, looking equally pretty but in a
completely different way. She's exotic-pretty. Sexy-pretty.
She's wearing a tight-fitting top with thin straps, and her
dark wavy hair is cascading over her bare shoulders.
Hailey peels away from the pack and speeds toward me
with her arms spread wide. She throws them around my
neck and says, “God, you have no idea how much I missed
you this summer!” I squeeze her tighter and tell her I
missed her, too. She looks amazing, still tanned from her
summer in Spain.
Olivia's now within arm's reach, so I grasp big chunks of
her newly dyed jet-black hair with both hands. “Okay, this is
totally working for you!” I tell her, and she pops her hip and
says, “I know, right?”
As my friends close in, all the people around us stop what
they're doing to gather in a little tighter. Because that's
what happens when the Crazy Eights do anything. People
watch.
We started calling ourselves that back in kindergarten,
and it kind of stuck. There were eight of us until freshman
year, when Ella's family moved to San Diego and Hannah
transferred to a private high school. Last year, Sarah landed
the lead in the school play and started hanging out with her
new drama club friends. And we were down to five.
That's when I started to realize that friendships in odd
numbers are complicated. Eight was good. Six was good.
But five? Five was bad, because someone's always the odd
girl out. Often, that's me.
“Happy birthday, gorgeous!” Alexis says, bouncing in
place as she gives me the cupcake.
The smile on my face grows even wider. “My birthday
was two weeks ago.”
“True, but we were all talking about how much it must
suck to have a summer birthday. None of us even got to
celebrate with you.” I'm surprised Alexis hasn't mentioned
this earlier. I saw her twice last week, and both times we
talked about the spa day her mom is planning and the new
convertible she's getting for her birthday.
“This is so perfect, you guys,” I say, holding up the
cupcake and then pointing to the bow on my locker.
“Seriously. Thank you.”
There's a chorus of You're welcomes and We love yous.
And then Alexis steps forward. “Hey,” she whispers. “Sorry
about all the texts this morning, but I have to talk to you
about something and I was hoping to do it in private.”
“What's up?” I try to make my voice sound light, but the
second she said the words “I have to talk to you,” my
stomach twisted right back into that tight knot I've been
trying to loosen since the parking lot. Those words are never
good.
“We'll talk about it at lunch,” she says. And just when I
was starting to feel like this was the best first day of school
ever, I'm now dreading lunch.
Kaitlyn steps in to hug me. “Are you shaking?” she asks.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
“Too much coffee this morning, I guess.” The warning bell
rings and I turn to my locker and start dialing the
combination with trembling fingers. “I'll see you guys later.”
Once the Eights are gone, the rest of the crowd takes off
to first period. I set the cupcake on the empty shelf and
grab the door to steady myself.
Taped on the inside of my locker door, I see all the photos
and mementos I've saved over the last two years. There are
pictures of the five of us dressed up in the school colors for
spirit week, and the four of us surrounding Kaitlyn when she
won homecoming princess last year. There's a copy of the
noise ordinance we got when Alexis's parents left town last
Halloween and we threw this epic party people talked about
for months afterward. Scattered around, covering any sliver
of paint, are my ticket stubs. It's an impressive, eclectic
collection—ranging from bands no one's ever heard of to
names like Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and Justin Timberlake—
thanks to Olivia's dad, who owns an indie record label and
always gets us seats in the VIP section.
I use the small mirror to check my makeup and whisper,
“Don't. Freak. Out.” Then I close the door and stare at the
wrapping one more time, letting my fingertip trail across the
surface, running my thumb across the silver bow.
“That was really nice.” The voice is so faint, at first I
wonder if I'm hearing things. I turn to see who spoke, but
her locker is blocking her face.
“Excuse me?” I hope she didn't see me pathetically
fondling the bow.
“You have really nice friends.” She swings the door
closed and walks over to me, pointing at the wrapping
paper. I almost reply “Not always,” but I catch myself. It's a
new year. A new start. And today, I do have really nice
friends.
“How'd they get your locker open?”
“They all know the combo. It's kind of a birthday
tradition. We've been wrapping each other's lockers since
middle school. This is only the second time they've wrapped
mine, but you know, those were big birthdays. Thirteen and
now…” I reach for the silver bow again. “Sixteen.”
Why am I telling her this?
I look around, realizing that the corridors are now empty.
“I'm sorry. Do I know you?”
“Apparently not.” She points to the end of the row. “My
locker has been there since freshman year, but we haven't
formally met or anything. I'm Caroline Madsen.”
I take her in, starting with her feet. Brown hiking boots.
Baggy, faded jeans. An unbuttoned flannel shirt that might
be considered cool if it belonged to her boyfriend, but I'm
pretty sure that's not the case. Underneath it, her T-shirt
reads, WHAT WOULD SCOOBY DOO? That makes me laugh to
myself. I continue up to her face. Not a stitch of makeup. A
purple-and-white-striped ski cap, even though it's the end of
August. In California.
“Samantha McAllister.” The final bell rings, signaling that
we're both officially tardy on the first day of school.
She tugs on her shirtsleeve, uncovering an old, beat-up
watch. “We'd better get to class. It was nice to meet you,
Sam.”
Sam.
Last year, I asked the Eights to call me Sam. Kaitlyn
laughed and said that's her dog's name, and Olivia said it's
a guy's name, and Alexis declared that she would never,
ever go by Alex.
I watch Caroline round the corner, and by then, it's too
late to correct her.
We're eating lunch under our tree in the quad when Alexis
takes a dramatic breath, places her palms flat on the
ground, and leans into the circle. “I can't stand this
anymore. I have something to tell you guys.”
Kaitlyn rests a hand on Alexis's back, like she's offering
silent reassurance. “It's about my birthday this weekend,”
Alexis says, and the rest of us squeeze in tight. “We've been
planning to go to this amazing spa in Napa for months now,
right? Well, I guess my mom should have scheduled the
appointments earlier, because when she called two weeks
ago, they told her there was a wedding this weekend and
everything was booked solid.” She sighs dramatically. “She
could only get three appointments.”
“Whatever. We'll go to another spa,” Olivia says.
“That's what I suggested. But my mom said she called all
the high-end places, and none of them could accommodate
all of us on such short notice. Besides, this is her favorite—
she's been going there on special occasions for years—and
she's always wanted to take me.”
“Can we go on Sunday instead? Or the following
weekend?” I ask.
Alexis looks at me and her eyebrows knit together.
“Saturday's my birthday, Samantha.”
She takes a sharp inhale as she removes two envelopes
from her bag. She hands one to Kaitlyn and the other to
Olivia. “I've been thinking about this nonstop over the last
week, and I finally decided it was only fair to pick the two
people I've known the longest.”
“You've known all of us since kindergarten,” Hailey says,
voicing what I'm pretty sure each one of us is thinking.
“True, but our moms,” she says, gesturing to Kaitlyn and
Olivia, “knew each other when we were in preschool,” and
the two of them nod like that explains everything. Then they
actually have the audacity to start opening their envelopes
in front of us.
Again, Hailey speaks on behalf of us losers. “Samantha
has a car now. Maybe the two of us can drive up and meet
you for lunch?”
Hailey's pleading expression makes me actually consider
it for a moment. But Mom and Dad would never agree. Even
if they did, what would happen when we arrived at the
restaurant? It might take me ten minutes to park correctly.
What if there's a valet?
I can't drive.
“I thought about that,” Alexis says. “But she won't drive
with passengers. Right, Samantha?” My face gets hotter the
longer they stare at me.
I shake my head. Alexis glances around the circle,
shifting the blame to me, using nothing but her eyes.
The thoughts start gathering, butting up against the
caution tape surrounding my brain, strategizing and
preparing to rush in and take over. I hold them off, telling
myself all the right things, repeating the mantras, taking
deep breaths, counting slowly.
One. Breathe.
Two. Breathe.
Three. Breathe.
It's not working. My face is getting hotter and my hands
are clammy and my breathing feels shallow and I need to
get out of here. Fast.
I pull my phone out of my pocket and pretend I just
received a text. “I have to run. My new lab partner needs
my notes from class.” I pack up my untouched sandwich,
hoping no one asks about the lab partner I don't actually
have.
“You're not upset, are you?” Alexis asks sweetly.
I bite the inside of my lower lip three times before I make
eye contact. “Of course not. We get it, right?” I direct the
question at Hailey, acknowledging the two of us as allies,
stuck on the bottom rungs of Alexis's social ladder.
And then I walk away as slowly as possible, ignoring the
fact that every muscle in my body wants to run.
When I feel the first sign of a panic attack, I'm supposed
to go to a quiet place with dim lighting, where I can be alone
and get my thoughts under control. My psychiatrist has
burned these instructions into my brain in a way that makes
them second nature, but instead I duck around the corner
out of sight and stand there, my back against the science
building, my face pressed into my hands, like I can achieve
the same effect if I can only block out the glare of the sun.
Eventually, I start walking through campus and let the path
take me wherever it leads.
It leads me to the theater.
I've been here before for the annual talent show, the
band recital, school plays—basically, the slew of events
we're forced to attend because they take place in lieu of
class. The five of us always ditch our assigned row and sit
together in the back, snickering to ourselves and poking fun
at the people on stage, until one of the teachers gets tired
of shushing us and sends us all outside, as if that's
punishment. We sit on the grass, talking and laughing, until
everyone who had to stay and watch the entire performance
finally files out.
I hunker down in a seat in the center of the first row,
because it's actually darkest here, and I'm already feeling
calmer, despite the fact that Alexis just force-ranked her
best friends and put me on the bottom. On the bright side, I
no longer have to waste so much time wondering where I fit.
The bell rings and I'm about to get up and head for class,
when I hear voices. I crouch down lower, watching a group
of people walk across the stage, talking to each other in
hushed tones. A guy's voice says, “See you Thursday.”
The last person emerges from behind the curtain. She's
about to disappear on the opposite side when she stops and
takes a few deliberate steps backward. Resting her hands on
her hips, she scans the theater and sees me in the front row.
“Hey.” She walks over and sits with her legs dangling
over the edge of the stage.
I narrow my eyes to get a better look at her in the dark.
“Caroline?” I ask.
“Wow. You remembered my name,” she says as she
jumps down and collapses into the seat on my right. “I'm
kind of surprised by that.”
“Why?”
“I don't know. I guess I assumed you were the type of
person I'd have to introduce myself to more than once
before it would actually stick.”
“Caroline Madsen,” I say, proving that I even
remembered her last name.
She looks a little impressed. “So did you see the rest of
us?” she asks, pointing at the empty stage.
“I guess. I saw a bunch of people go by. Why?”
Her mouth turns down at the corners. “No reason. Just
wondering.”
But now she has me curious. And besides, this is a great
distraction. “Who were they? Where were you coming
from?”
“Nowhere. We were just…looking around.” I start to press
her for more details, but before I can say anything, she
leans over, stopping a few inches short of my face. “Have
you been crying?”
I sink down farther in my chair.
“Guy trouble?” she asks.
“No.”
“Girl trouble?” She looks at me out of the corner of her
eye.
“No. Not like that. But, well…actually yeah, sort of.”
“Let me guess.” She taps her finger against her temple.
“Your locker-wrapping best friends are actually manipulative
bitches?”
I look up at her from under my eyelashes. “Sometimes. Is
it that obvious?”
“You can take in a lot of information from a few lockers
away.” She scoots back into her chair and slides down,
kicking her legs out in front of her and crossing them at the
ankles, mirroring my posture exactly. “You know what you
need?” I don't answer her, and after a long pause she says,
“Nicer friends.”
“Funny. My psychiatrist has been saying that for years.”
As soon as the words leave my mouth, I suck in a breath.
No one outside my family knows about my psychiatrist.
She's not my biggest secret, but she's right up there with
the rest of them. I look over at Caroline for a reaction,
expecting a biting comment or a condescending stare.
“Why do you see a psychiatrist?” she asks, like it's no big
deal.
Apparently I'm not keeping secrets from her, because
words start spilling out on their own. “OCD. I'm more
obsessive than compulsive, so most of the ‘disorder' part
takes place in my own head. That makes it pretty easy to
hide. No one knows.”
I can't believe I'm saying this out loud.
She's looking at me like she's actually interested, so I
keep talking. “But I obsess about a lot of things, like guys
and my friends and totally random stuff.…I sort of latch on
to a thought and I can't let it go. Sometimes the thoughts
come rapid-fire and cause an anxiety attack. Oh, and I have
this weird thing with the number three. I count a lot. I sort of
have to do things in threes.”
“Why threes?”
I slowly shake my head. “I have no idea.”
“That sounds pretty horrible, Sam.”
Sam.
Caroline's looking at me as if this whole thing is
completely fascinating. She leans forward, resting her
elbows on her knees, exactly the way my psychiatrist does
when she wants me to keep talking. So I do.
“I can't turn my thoughts off, so I barely sleep. Without
meds, I don't get much more than three or four hours a
night. It's been that way since I was ten.” Now there's a hint
of sympathy in her eyes. I don't want her to feel sorry for
me. “It's okay. I'm on antianxiety meds. And I know how to
control the panic attacks.” At least, I think I do. It's been a
little harder since the bizarre impulse to slash the
Valentine's Day roses.
“I started seeing a psychiatrist when I was thirteen,”
Caroline says matter-of-factly. After a long pause she adds,
“Depression.”
“Really?” I ask, resting my elbow on the armrest between
us.
“We've tried different antidepressants over the years,
but…I don't know…sometimes it feels like it's getting worse,
not better.”
“I was on antidepressants for a while, too.” It sounds so
strange to hear myself admit all this. I've never talked with
anyone my age about this stuff.
Caroline reclines into the chair and smiles. She looks
pretty when she does. She'd be even prettier if she would
just wear a little makeup.
I bet I could help her.
I no longer have plans to be at a fancy spa with my four
best friends this weekend. I don't have any plans at all.
“Hey, what are you doing on Saturday night?”
She crinkles her nose. “I don't know. Nothing. Why?”
“Want to come to my house? We can watch a movie or
something.”
Maybe I could talk her into letting me give her a minimakeover,
too. A few highlights to give her hair a little
dimension. Some concealer to hide the pockmarks and
blemishes. Nothing dramatic, just a touch of color on her
cheeks, eyes, lips.
Caroline pulls a pen out of the front pocket of her baggy
jeans.
“I'll text it to you,” I say, reaching for my phone.
She shakes her head. “Technology is a trap,” she says,
waving her pen in the air. “Go.” I give her my house number
and street, and she scribbles it on her palm and pockets the
pen again. Then she bounces up from her chair so quickly, I
jump in my seat. She backs toward the stage, places her
hands on the surface, and with a little hop, she's sitting on
the edge again. She leans forward and checks the room. “I
want to help you, Sam.”
Wait. What? She wants to help me? “What do you
mean?”
“Can you keep a secret?”
I'm great at secrets. My friends tell me all their dirt,
knowing I'll never breathe a word of it to anyone. They have
no idea I've been keeping a mental disorder from them for
the last five years.
“Of course I can,” I say.
“Good. I want to show you something. But if I do, you
can't tell anyone. And I mean anyone. Not even your
shrink.”
“But I tell her everything.”
“Not this.”
Caroline waves me over to her. “See that spot over
there?” She points at the piano in the corner of the stage.
“Come back here on Thursday, right after the lunch bell
rings, and wait for me. Don't say a word to anyone. Hide on
this side of the curtain and don't come out until I come get
you.”
“Why?”
“Because.” She grabs me by the shoulders. “I'm going to
show you something that will change your whole life.”
I roll my eyes. “Oh, please.”
“It might not.” Caroline moves her hands to my cheeks.
“But if I'm right about you, it will.”
The elevator is already waiting. I press 7 and then,
because I can't help it, I press 7 two more times. As soon as
I open the office door and step inside, Colleen's head pops
up from behind the counter and her whole face brightens.
“Ah, it must be Wednesday!”
At first, I found her regular greeting mortifying, but then I
realized there are never any other patients here, and even if
there were, there's no reason to hide. We're all regulars.
“She's running about five minutes late. Water?” she asks,
and I nod.
I fish my phone out of my purse, pop in my earbuds, and
put on my typical waiting room playlist, In the Deep, named
for lyrics in a Florence + the Machine song. I think of my
naming strategy as a hobby, even though my psychiatrist
doesn't see it that way. I don't simply listen to music, I study
the lyrics, and when I'm done making a playlist, I pick three
words from one of the songs—three words that perfectly
encapsulate the collection—and that becomes its title.
I let my head fall back against the wall and close my
eyes, ignoring all the motivational posters hanging above
me. I mentally transport myself back to the pool two weeks
ago, to that moment when Brandon kissed me but didn't,
and I feel my face relax as I relive the fantasy again. His
mouth was so warm. And he smelled good, like Sprite and
coconut sunscreen.
“She's ready for you,” Colleen says.
Sue's office hasn't changed in five years. The same
books line the same shelves, and the same certificates hang
from the walls covered in the same beige paint. The same
photographs of the same children stand propped up on her
desk, suspended in time like the office itself.
“Hey, Sam!” Sue crosses the room to greet me. She's this
tiny Japanese woman with thick black hair that hangs to her
shoulders, and she's always impeccably dressed. She looks
like she'd be refined and soft-spoken until she opens her
mouth.
I'd only been seeing her for a few months when I came
up with the nickname “Shrink-Sue.” I never actually thought
I'd call her that to her face, but one day, it slipped out. She
asked me how I came up with it, and I told her it sounded
like something badass you'd call out while throwing a judo
chop.
Until that point, I hadn't really stopped to question
whether or not psychiatrists appreciated being called
shrinks. I was only eleven years old. And I didn't want to
offend her, but once I'd said it, I couldn't take it back.
But Sue said she liked the name. And she told me I could
call her anything. I could even call her a bitch, to her face or
behind her back, because there would certainly be times I'd
want to. I liked her even more after that.
She sits in the chair across from me and hands me my
“thinking putty.” It's supposed to take my mind off the
words I'm saying and give me something to do with my
hands so I don't spend the entire fifty-minute session
scratching the back of my neck in threes.
“So,” she begins, opening the brown leather folio across
her lap like she always does. “Where do you want to start
today?”
Not with the Eights. Not with the spa.
“I don't know.” I wish I could tell her about my secret
meeting with Caroline tomorrow, because that's pretty
much all I've thought about over the last two days, but I
can't break my promise. Then I think about the rest of the
conversation, the two of us bonding over medication and
therapy sessions.
“Actually, I sort of…made a new friend this week.” The
words sound so dorky coming out of my mouth, but
apparently Shrink-Sue doesn't hear them that way, because
her eyes light up like this is the best news she's heard in
ages.
“Really? What's she like?” she asks, and I feel myself
mimicking her smile. I can't help it. I think about the way
Caroline put her hands on my face like an old friend. That
look in her eyes when she said she wanted to help me. The
whole thing caught me completely off guard.
“Well, she's not like any of the Crazy Eights,” I say,
picturing her long stringy hair and lack of makeup and those
chunky hiking boots. “She's kind of awkward, but she's nice.
I barely know her, but I already think she sort of…gets me.”
Sue opens her mouth, but I hold my finger up in the air
between us before she can speak. “Please. Don't say it.”
Her mouth snaps shut.
“This doesn't mean I'm leaving the Eights. You always
make it sound easy, Sue, but I can't just ‘find new friends.'”
I put air quotes on the last words. “They are my friends.
These are the people that every girl in my class aspires to
be friends with. Besides, it would kill them if I left. Especially
Hailey.”
Sue shifts in her chair and crosses one leg over the other,
taking an authoritative pose. “You have to make decisions
that are best for you, Sam. Not for Hailey or anyone else,”
she says in her straightforward way.
“Sarah made a decision that was best for her, and look
what happened.”
I'm not about to be on the receiving end of what we all
did to Sarah. Shooting her dirty looks as we passed her in
the halls, talking about her from the other side of the
cafeteria, leaving her out of our plans for the weekend. I'm
not proud of myself, but when she dumped us for her drama
club friends, we made it feel like an act of disloyalty on her
part.
“She's probably quite happy,” Sue says.
“I'm sure she is. But being part of the Eights makes me
happy.”
Their friendship might require weekly therapy, but I have
fun with them. And I'd be truly crazy to say good-bye to
parties every weekend, cute guys crowded around us at
lunch, and VIP tickets to every major concert that comes to
town.
“Either way, this is a really positive step, Sam. I'm glad to
see you making new friends.”
“Friend. Singular. One person.” I hold up a finger. “And no
one can ever know about Caroline.”
“Why not?”
Before I even realize what's happening, my chin begins
to tremble. I take a deep breath to steady myself and stare
at the carpet.
“Why can't they know about her, Sam?” Sue repeats
softly.
“Because.” The word comes out all wobbly. “If they kick
me out—” I can't finish my thought. I squeeze the back of
my neck three times, as hard as I can, but it doesn't help. “I
don't have anyplace else to go.”
The tears start to well up, but I fight them off, biting the
inside of my lower lip, forcing my gaze toward the ceiling.
Sue must be able to tell how uncomfortable I am, because
she jumps in and says, “Hey, let's change the subject.”
“Please,” I whisper.
“Did you have a chance to print out those pictures?”
“Yeah.” I blow out a breath and reach into my bag.
Dad took a bunch of photos during the county
championship meet and sent them to me. Last week, I
showed them to Sue. She spent twenty minutes sliding her
fingertip across the screen of my phone, carefully taking in
each photo. Then she asked me to pick my three favorites,
print them out, and bring them with me today.
“These are great,” she says, taking her time to examine
each one. “Tell me, why did you choose these three?”
“I don't know,” I say with a shrug. “I guess because I look
happy.”
Her expression tells me that wasn't the answer she was
looking for. “What word comes to mind when you see this?”
she asks, holding one of the pictures up in front of me. “One
word.”
Cassidy is squeezing me hard; her nose is all scrunched
up and her mouth is open, like she's screaming. Dad took it
right after I beat her time by a tenth of a second, breaking
her record in girls' butterfly. I was afraid she'd be upset, but
she wasn't. “Friendship.”
She holds the next one up. My stomach feels all light and
fluttery when I see Brandon resting one hand on my
shoulder and pointing at the first-place medal around my
neck with the other. He kept high-fiving me. And hugging
me. All day.
Sue wouldn't approve of the word “love,” even though
it's the first one that pops into my mind, so I fix my gaze on
the medal, thinking about the way he made me push myself
all summer, making me believe I could be faster, stronger.
“Inspiration.”
I feel my face heat up and I'm relieved when Sue moves
on to the next picture and says, “I was really hoping you'd
print this one.”
Dad took it with a long lens and you can see every detail
in my face. I'm standing on the block in my stance, seconds
away from diving in, and even though my goggles are
covering my eyes, you can see them clearly. I stare at the
picture for a long time, trying to think of a single word to
describe what I like so much about it. I look strong.
Determined. Like a girl who speaks her mind, not someone
who cowers in the dark every time she gets her feelings
hurt.
“Confidence,” I finally say.
Sue's nod is proud and purposeful, and I can tell my word
was spot-on.
“Here's what I'd like you to do. Bring these to school
tomorrow and tape them on the inside of your locker door.”
She taps the last one with her perfectly manicured
fingernail. “Put this one right at eye level. Look at it off and
on all day to remind you of your goal this year. Which is?”
she prompts.
“I'm going to make swimming a priority, so I can get a
scholarship and go to the college of my choice. Even if it's
far away.”
The “far away” part makes me start hyperventilating. I
feel nauseous when I think about moving away from here,
leaving my mom, leaving Sue. But I force myself to stare at
the picture, locking in on that strong, determined
expression.
A swim scholarship. Competing at a college level. A
chance to reinvent myself.
This girl looks like someone who could do all those
things.
“And don't forget,” Sue says. “This isn't Summer Sam,
who shows up in June and disappears when school starts.
This is you.”
“Is it?” I ask, staring at the photo. It was only two weeks
ago, but I already feel like a completely different person.
Sue rests her elbows on her knees, forcing me to meet
her eyes. “Yes, it is. And she's in there all year long. I
promise. You just have to find a way to pull her out.”
On Thursday morning after first bell, I linger, taking my
time at my locker. I keep peering toward the end of the row,
looking for Caroline, but she hasn't shown up. I haven't seen
her once since we sat together in the theater on Monday.
Finally, I give up and race to class.
The last few days have been brutal, with Caroline's words
running through my head in an endless loop. I can't imagine
what she wants to show me today or how it could possibly
change my whole life. And if she's right about me? What
does that even mean?
Lunch can't come soon enough. As soon as the fourth
period bell sounds, I stand up and race past the rest of my
U.S. History classmates, bolting for the door. Everyone
heads for the cafeteria and the quad, but I take off in the
opposite direction.
When I arrive at the double doors that lead into the
theater, I take a quick look around. Then I slip inside and go
straight to the piano, hiding from view like Caroline told me
to.
I keep checking the time on my phone, and I'm starting
to wonder if this is all a joke, when I hear voices, quiet but
audible, coming toward me. I'm tempted to take a step
forward so I can get a look at their faces, but I press my
back flat against the curtain and tell myself not to move.
The voices fade away and Caroline pokes her head
around the curtain, curls her finger toward herself, and
whispers, “Follow me.”
“Where are we going?” I ask, and she brings her finger to
her lips, shushing me. We disappear backstage, and about
twenty feet away, I see a door closing. We wait for it to shut
completely, and then we creep forward.
“Open it,” she says, and then adds the word “quietly.”
She rests her hands on her hips and I read her T-shirt:
EVERYONE HATES ME BECAUSE I'M PARANOID.
I turn the knob as gently as I can, and soon I'm staring at
a steep, narrow staircase. My first instinct is to close the
door and turn back the way we came. I shoot Caroline a
questioning look and she gestures toward the stairs. “Go
ahead. Go down.”
“Down?”
She raises an eyebrow. “Well they don't go up, now do
they?”
No. They don't.
“Here,” she says. “I'll go first.” And before I can say
another word, she pushes past me and starts down the
stairs, and because I can't imagine doing anything else at
this point, I close the door behind us and follow her.
The narrow hallway is painted dark gray, and I look up at
the ceiling lights, wondering why they're so dim. Caroline
and I turn down another hallway just in time to see the door
at the far end swinging shut. I stay on her heels until we're
standing in front of it.
This is beyond creepy. “What is this place?”
She ignores my question and points to the doorknob.
“Okay, I'm going to be by your side the entire time, but this
is all up to you from here. You have to do all the talking.”
“Talking? To whom? What do you mean, it's up to me?”
“You'll see.”
I don't want to see. I want to leave. Now.
“This is bizarre, Caroline. There's no one down here.” I try
not to look like I'm rattled, but I am. And I can't imagine how
anything in a freaky basement underneath the school
theater could possibly change my life. My mind's operating
on overload now, my thoughts racing, and I feel a panic
attack coming on.
What was I thinking? I don't even know her.
I turn away and start heading back the way I came.
“Sam,” she says, and I stop, just like that. Caroline grips
my forearm and looks right into my eyes. “Please, check it
out.”
There's something about the look on her face that makes
me want to trust her, like I've known her all my life. And as
nervous as I am, I'm even more curious to see what's on the
other side of that door.
“Fine,” I say, clenching my teeth. I reach for the knob and
turn.
The room on the other side is small and painted
completely black. Black ceiling. Black floor. Metal shelving
units stocked with cleaning supplies line three of the walls,
and the other one is covered with hanging mops and
brooms.
Caroline points to a section of mop heads gently swaying
back and forth against the wall, as if they'd recently been
touched. I pull them to one side, exposing a seam that runs
all the way up the wall until it meets another one at the top.
It's a door. The hinges are painted black and so is the dead
bolt, camouflaging everything perfectly.
“Knock,” Caroline commands from behind me. I do what
I'm told without questioning or arguing or second-guessing.
First there's a click, and then the door swings toward me
and I see a pair of eyes in the narrow opening. “Who are
you?” a girl's voice whispers.
I glance over at Caroline, but she just gives me this Say
something! look, so I return to the girl in the doorway.
“I'm Samantha.” I hold my hand up. “I mean, Sam.” Why
not, I figure, as long as I'm making introductions and all. “I
was hoping I could come in.”
She looks past me, over my shoulder, and Caroline
whispers, “She's with me.”
The girl makes a face but pushes the door open anyway,
giving us enough room to step inside. Then she scans the
janitor's closet, like she's checking to be sure the two of us
are alone, and I hear the dead bolt snap closed again.
I don't even have time to take in the surroundings
because now there's a guy standing in front of me. He's tall
and thin, with broad shoulders and a headful of sandy blond
hair. He looks a little bit familiar, and I'm still trying to place
him when he narrows his eyes at me and says, “What are
you doing here?”
I look at Caroline for help again, but she runs her finger
across her lips like she's zipping them shut, and I kind of
want to punch her right now.
“I'm Sam—” I begin, but he cuts me off.
“I know who you are, Samantha.” I study his face again.
He knows my name. I don't know his.
“I'm sorry.” I'm not really sure why I'm apologizing, but it
seems like the right thing to do. I step backward toward the
door, feeling for a knob, but there isn't one.
The girl who let me in hands him a thick braided cord and
he slips it over his head. A gold key bounces against his
chest.
“How did you find this room?”
“My friend…” I say, gesturing toward Caroline. He
glances over at her and she nods at him. He quickly returns
his attention to me.
“Your friend what?”
Caroline's made it pretty clear that she isn't going to do
anything to help me at this point, but that doesn't mean her
words can't get me the rest of the way into the room. “I
heard that this place might change my life, and, well…I
guess my life could use some serious changing, so I
thought…” I trail off, watching him, waiting for his face to
relax, but it doesn't.
He stares at me for what feels like a full minute. I stare
back, refusing to give in. Caroline must be getting worried,
because she wraps both hands around my arm and pulls
herself in closer, showing him she's on my side. He crosses
his arms and never takes his eyes off me.
“Fine,” he says. “You can stay today, this one time, but
that's it. After this, you have to forget all about this place,
got it? One time, Samantha.”
“Got it,” I say. Then I add, “And it's Sam.”
His forehead creases. “Fine. But it's not like this makes us
friends or anything.”
Friends? My friends don't call me Sam. “Why would I
think we're friends? I don't even know you.”
He smiles, revealing a dimple on the left side of his
mouth. “No,” he says, as if it's funny. “Of course you don't
know me.” He walks away, shaking his head, leaving
Caroline and me standing alone at the back of the room.
“What the hell was that?” I ask her. My voice is even
more wobbly than it was a few minutes ago.
She gives me a supportive nudge with her elbow. “Don't
worry about it. You did great.”
Now that he's no longer blocking my view, I can see
where I am. The room is long and narrow and, like the
janitor's closet, painted entirely in black. But the ceilings are
twice as high, and even though it's dark, it's not
claustrophobic at all. At the front of the room, I see a low
riser that appears to be a makeshift stage. Smack in the
center, there's a wooden stool.
I count five other people in the room. They're sitting on
small couches and oversize chairs facing the stage and set
at a slight angle, each one covered in different material—
blue crushed velvet, brown leather, red and gray checks—
and completely unique. Low bookcases line the room, and
small mismatched lamps are spaced evenly around the
perimeter. I nervously wonder what would happen if the
power went out.
Then I see the walls.
I spin a slow 360 in place, taking it all in. All four walls
are covered with scraps of paper in different colors and
shapes and textures, all jutting out at various angles. Lined
paper ripped from spiral-bound notebooks. Plain paper,
three-hole punched. Graph paper, torn at the edges. Pages
that have yellowed with age, along with napkins and Post-its
and brown paper lunch bags and even a few candy
wrappers.
Caroline's watching me, and I take a few cautious steps
closer to get a better look. I reach for one of the pages,
running the corner between my thumb and forefinger, and
that's when I notice handwriting on each one, as distinctive
as the paper itself. Loopy, flowing cursive. Tight, angular
letters. Precise, blocky printing.
Wow.
I don't think I've ever experienced this sensation outside
the pool, but I feel it now, deep in my bones. My shoulders
drop. My heart's no longer racing. I can't see a toxic,
negative thought for miles.
“What is this place?” I whisper to Caroline, but before she
can say anything, the girl I met at the door comes out of
nowhere and grabs my arm. She has dark hair and a pixie
cut, and now she's bouncing in place like this is the most
exciting thing that's happened to her in a long time.
“Come sit with me. There's an open spot on the couch in
front.” She starts leading me toward this atrocious greenand-
pink-plaid sofa in the first row. “How long have you
been writing?”
For what feels like the one-hundredth time today, my
head spins toward Caroline. She's got a weird grin on her
face. “Writing?”
“Don't worry,” Pixie Cut says. She tightens her grip on
my arm and pulls me closer. “I'm the newest one here and I
totally remember my first time. Don't be afraid. You're only
here to listen.”
She plops down on one end of the couch and pats the
cushion on her right. “Sit.” I do as I'm told. “Well, you
definitely picked a good day,” she says. “Sydney's going
first and AJ's up after her.”
Caroline settles in on my other side. I look to her for
clues, and again she gives me nothing.
Everyone gets quiet as a heavyset girl I assume to be
Sydney climbs up to the stage and bumps the stool with her
hip, scooting it to the side. Wait. I know her. She's in my U.S.
History class.
I'd never seen her before this week, but on the first day
of school, she strolled into class wearing a black strappy
dress with bright red cherries all over it. It looked vintage.
But it wasn't her outfit or her confidence that caught my
attention. It was her hair. Long, thick, and bright red, like
Cassidy's. I'd already been thinking about her all day,
wishing the two of us were at the pool instead, and seeing
that hair made me miss her even more.
Sydney holds up the top of a Chicken McNuggets
container. “I wrote this last night at…” She flips the paper
around to show us the McDonald's arches and bounces her
hand up and down, nodding proudly. “The lid wasn't as
greasy this time, so I got an entire poem in,” she says, and
everyone laughs at what I presume to be an inside joke.
“I call this one Neujay.” She turns the paper around again
and runs her fingertip across the word “Nuggets,” and then
clears her throat dramatically.
ENTRY
My teeth pierce your bumpy flesh.
Oil, sweet, slipping over my tongue
Sliding down my throat.
DECISIONS
Barbecue or sweet and sour?
Mustard or honey?
I close my eyes
Let fate decide.
Tip, dip, lift
Barbecue.
STUDY
Golden. Shining under fluorescents.
Piled. Grazing each other's edges.
Patient. Always patient.
ADMIRATION
Gold, pink.
Crispy, salty.
What the hell are you made of?
Everyone stands, clapping and cheering, and Sydney
holds her skirt to one side and curtsies. Then she throws her
arms up in the air and her head back and yells, “Yes! Stick
me!”
Some guy on the other couch tosses a glue stick at her.
She catches it in the air, removes the cap, and, using the
stool as a table, runs the glue back and forth across the
McDonald's logo.
She steps off the stage and I think she's walking toward
me, but she passes our couch and stops at the wall. We all
watch as she smacks what's left of the Chicken McNuggets
lid against it. Brushing her hands together, she settles into a
spot on the couch behind me and our eyes meet. She smiles
at me. I smile back. I don't think I've ever heard her speak
until now.
When I turn around again, the guy who let me inside is
taking the stage. He perches himself on the stool and picks
up the acoustic guitar that's strapped over his shoulder.
How do I know him?
I follow the string around his neck, and picture that gold
key hiding behind his guitar.
“I wrote this last weekend in my room. And, okay, I'm
sayin' it.” He pauses for dramatic effect. “This one sucks.”
He stands up, holds his hands in front of him, and lets the
guitar fall slack so the strap catches it. He's gesturing
toward himself in this go-ahead-let-me-have-it kind of way,
and everyone around me starts ripping papers out of
notebooks, balling them up, and chucking them at him. He
laughs and keeps gesturing with his hands, silently telling
them to keep it coming.
I look over at Caroline. She won't make eye contact with
me, so I lightly elbow pixie-cut girl. “Why are they doing
that?” I ask, and she comes in close to my ear. “It's one of
the rules. You can't criticize anyone's poetry, but especially
not your own.”
He perches himself on the stool and picks up his guitar
again, and the second he does, the paper stops flying. He
starts plucking the strings, and this melody fills the room.
He's only playing a few notes, but they sound so pretty
together this way, over and over again. And then he starts
singing.
So long, Lazy Ray.
Were you a crack you'd be tempting to look through.
Were you my coat on a cold day,
You'd lose track of the ways you were worn.
And it's true.
I haven't got a clue.
How to love you.
He's not looking at any of us. He's just staring down at
the guitar, picking at the strings. He sings two more verses,
and his voice rises higher, louder when he reaches the
chorus. After another verse, the tempo slows, and I can tell
the song is winding down.
Like sunlight dancing on my skin,
You'll still be in my mind.
So I'm only gonna say,
So long, Lazy Ray.
The last note lingers in the silence. Everyone remained
quiet for a second or two, but now they're on their feet,
clapping and cheering and tossing more paper balls at his
head as he swats them away. Then they start pelting him
with glue sticks.
He manages to catch one as it bounces off the wall
behind him, and then he does that musician thing, slipping
his guitar around his back in one fluid motion. He's shaking
his head as if he's embarrassed by the attention, and pulls a
piece of paper out of the back pocket of his jeans. He
unfolds it, flattens it against the stool, and rubs glue along
the back before he steps down from the stage.
He walks to the other side of the room and, still clutching
the paper, bows once. Then he reaches up high on the wall,
smacking his words against it.
I'm trying to figure out if everyone else is as taken aback
as I am, but they don't seem to be. Didn't anyone else think
that was amazing? Because while all of them are clearly
enjoying this moment, none of them look quite as surprised
as I am, and I'm pretty sure their arms aren't covered in
goose bumps like mine are. They all look relatively unfazed.
Except Caroline.
She's grinning ear to ear, and as we take our seats again,
she threads her arm through mine and rests her chin on my
shoulder. “I knew it,” she says. “I was right about you.”
As I scan the room, taking in the slips of paper scattered
around me, I think I catch Caroline and pixie-cut girl look at
each other. “What is this place?” I ask again, hearing the
amazement in my own voice.
Pixie Cut answers me. “We call it Poet's Corner.”
The next day, I see them in the places they must have
been all along.
When I walk into U.S. History, Sydney spots me right
away and the two of us exchange knowing glances. Later
that day, as I'm heading to lunch, I pass Pixie Cut and
overhear her friend call her Abigail. I recognize a girl in the
student parking lot and another in the library. Each time I
make eye contact with any of them, I get a hint of a smile,
like we're still separated by an invisible barrier, but now we
have something in common: a secret. By the end of the day,
I've seen all but one.
I'm heading to my car when I look up and finally see AJ
heading straight for me, and I feel the corners of my mouth
twitching into a nervous grin. I'm expecting the same
reaction I got from the others. A sly wave. A chin tilt. But
instead he passes right by me, his eyes fixed on the ground
in front of him. When I'm a safe distance away, I stop and
turn around, watching until he disappears from sight.
I'm trying to decide what to do when Alexis appears out
of nowhere, her high heels tapping on the cement and her
thumbs tapping on her cell phone.
“There you are!” She stuffs her phone in the back pocket
of her jeans. “I was hoping to catch you. I just got the best
news!” She pulls me close. “There was a cancellation at the
spa. My mom was able to book another appointment.”
I look at her sideways.
“Don't you get it?” The words squeak out and she does a
little dance in place, shaking my arm around as she bounces
and beams and watches me, like she's expecting me to join
in. “You can come.”
“What about Hailey?”
She purses her lips and looks around, checking to be sure
we're alone. “No…” she draws the single word out, like it's a
musical note. “Not Hailey. You.” She pokes my collarbone.
And now I know precisely where I reside on her social
ladder: second rung from the bottom. Hailey occupies the
last one, and as soon as she learns I'm invited to Alexis's
birthday and she's not, she'll know it too.
“You have no idea how sad I've been, Samantha. I felt
horrible not asking you. Even though our moms weren't
friends in preschool, you and I were best friends in
kindergarten!” I take note of her word choice. I'm not her
best friend now, but I was in kindergarten. “I'm glad you're
coming. Oh, and plan to spend the night, too.”
“Is Hailey spending the night?” I ask. The spa might not
be able to accommodate all five of us, but Alexis's
enormous bedroom doesn't have any space constraints.
“That would be awkward, don't you think?” I think it
would be better than nothing, but I don't say so. “In fact,
keep it to yourself, okay? I wouldn't want to hurt Hailey's
feelings.”
No. Of course you wouldn't.
I unwind my arm from her grasp. “I've got to get to swim
practice,” I say.
Her face falls, but she quickly recovers, twisting her
mouth into a fake grin, raising her voice a full octave. “Yeah,
of course. Nine o'clock tomorrow. We'll pick you up.”
She takes off in the opposite direction. Part of me still
feels guilty about Hailey, but another part of me is excited
to spend the day with my friends, getting pampered at a
luxurious spa. It will be fun. And it's nice to not be the fifth
wheel for once.
I'm on the diving block, staring into lane three, running my
thumb across the scratchy surface three times, waiting for
the whistle to blow.
When it does, my body responds just like it's supposed
to. My knees bend and my arms stretch, and my fingers cut
through the water's surface in the seconds before I feel it
drench my cheeks. Then the silence.
I kick hard underwater and try to lock in my song, but
nothing comes. As I pop up and start the fly, my strokes feel
sloppy, uneven, and by the time I turn and kick off the wall,
I'm at least four strokes behind everyone else. I climb out of
the pool and get in the back of the line.
Jackson Roth looks over his shoulder at me. “Coach is in a
mood today, isn't he?”
“I guess.”
We're down to a small group of swimmers now that
school's started. The numbers will keep dwindling as fall's
extracurricular activities begin, homework picks up, and it
becomes harder to squeeze in team workouts at the club.
I'm looking forward to that. I prefer to come here at night,
swimming under the stars with the adults. They keep to
themselves.
I press my fingertips hard into my temples, ignoring
everyone around me, while I breathe and try to focus my
energy. When it's my turn, I step onto the blocks again, slide
my thumb along the surface three times, and dive in,
waiting for a song—any song—to come.
And one finally does, but it's not one I expect. Those
notes AJ played the other day start running through my
head, and as soon as I surface, I know what song will be
taking me back and forth across the pool. I speed up the
tempo, and my body follows suit until I'm flying through the
lane, pushing hard off the wall, throwing my arms over my
head, feeling that adrenaline surge every time I lift my chest
out of the water.
The tune is clear in my head, but now I want to
remember the lyrics and I can't. Lazy ray…I think he was
singing about the sun going down. There was a line about
sunlight dancing on your skin and another about a crack in a
fence or something.
What was that line?
I'm still trying to piece it together as I step into the
shower to rinse off the chlorine. I'm alone in the locker
room, so I start humming as I pull on my sweats and pile my
hair into a messy bun. On the drive home, I leave the stereo
off because I prefer his song over anything I have on a
playlist. And I have to remember all the lyrics. It's driving
me nuts.
It's easy to stay lost in my thoughts during dinner. Paige
got sent to the principal's office today for talking back to a
teacher, so she has my parents' undivided attention. My
family is arguing over the distinction between “clarifying
questions” and “back talk,” while I drift off to a better place.
I'm picturing that room and its walls, covered in torn
notebook pages and ripped-up napkins, pieces of brown
paper lunch sacks and fast-food wrappers, and how all that
chaos and disorder gave me such a strange sort of peace. I
can visualize the exact spot AJ slapped up those words. But
that's all I have. I can't download the song and listen to it on
repeat, looking up the lyrics online and deciphering them
like I typically would.
I have to get back down to that room.
I'm starting to recognize this for the obsession that it is,
but it doesn't bother me. It's innocent, like solving a puzzle.
My mind has certainly come up with more dangerous
fixations.
“Are you okay, Sam?” Mom asks.
Her voice snaps me back to reality, and when I look up
from my plate, Mom, Dad, and Paige are all staring at me.
Dad has a huge grin on his face.
“What?”
“You were singing,” he says.
“And humming,” Mom adds.
I was?
“Earworm,” I say. “This song has been stuck in my head
all day.”
“It was really pretty,” Paige says.
Under the table where no one can see me, I scratch my
jeans three times. “Yes, it was.”
I'm about to pop a sleeping pill when completely different
words start forming in my mind. I feel an overwhelming urge
to write them down.
I haven't thought about the notebooks in years, but
they're still on the top shelf of my bookcase, and I
remember exactly what Shrink-Sue said when she gave
them to me. I was to write every day, in the notebook that
best matched how I was feeling: the yellow notebook was
for happy thoughts. The red notebook was for when I was
angry and needed to vent. The blue one was for when I was
feeling good. Peaceful. Not happy, not angry. Neutral.
Somewhere in the middle.
I open the blue notebook first and see handwriting that
belonged to a much younger me. I'd clearly followed Sue's
advice for a while, but about a quarter of the way into the
book, the entries end.
The red book is filled with thoughts written with a heavier
hand. My penmanship is different, but I don't know if that's
because I was older or angrier. I read a few lines but stop
quickly. It's depressing.
But not as depressing as seeing that the yellow notebook
is completely empty.
Tossing the red and yellow ones on the floor, I crawl
under the covers with the blue one. Pen in hand, I flip to the
first blank page, but nothing's happening.
I don't know what to write about.
I could write about my OCD. Or the number three. Or
uncontrollable thought spirals that come out of nowhere,
demand my undivided attention, and scare me when they
won't stop. Or how I'm terrified about Alexis's birthday
tomorrow and it doesn't seem right to be afraid to spend the
day with your best friends.
Poets need words. Even when I have the right ones, I can
never seem to spit them out. Words only seem to serve me
when I'm in the pool.
The pool.
I put pen to paper, and off I go, writing about the one
thing that makes me feel healthy and happy and…normal.
Cutting through the surface. Hearing the whoosh and the
silence. Pushing off that cement wall with both feet, feeling
powerful and invincible. Loving how the water feels as it
slips over my cheeks.
Two hours later, I'm still going, still writing fast, still
turning pages. When I get to the end of the next page I
check the clock and realize two things: it's after midnight
and I forgot to take my sleep meds.
Normally, that would worry me, but it doesn't tonight. I'm
too elated to sleep.
I return to writing, filling my blue notebook, until I finally
drift off on my own, somewhere around three a.m.
We're all singing along with the music as we pull into the
spa entrance, but then Alexis's mom turns the stereo off
and we all fall silent, looking around, taking everything in.
The long driveway is lined with lush green trees and pale
pink rosebushes, and as the car winds up a steep hill and
past a vineyard, I roll down the window and breathe in the
scents of freshly cut grass and sweet-smelling lavender.
“Wow,” Olivia says from the backseat.
“No kidding,” Kaitlyn adds.
“I told you,” Alexis says.
I turn to Mrs. Mazeur. “This is incredible. Thank you.”
“You're going to love this,” she tells me.
Hailey would have loved this, too.
We pull up to a circular driveway with an enormous
fountain in the center. It must have a gravitational pull
because I start walking toward it, and then I stand there,
staring at the water cascading over the edge, listening to
the thick droplets land with soothing plinks into the pond
below. I close my eyes and let my mouth turn up at the
corners the way it wants to.
“Come here, girls!” Mrs. Mazeur is standing at the back
of the car, and we all gather around her. “I have a surprise.”
She pops the trunk, reaches inside, and pulls out a bright
green terry cloth bag with Alexis's name embroidered in
white. “One for you, birthday girl.”
As she reaches into the trunk again, Alexis unzips the
bag and sifts through the contents, pulling out body lotion
and cuticle cream and facial scrub.
“And one for you,” she says, handing Olivia the same
personalized bag in red, her favorite color. “Of course purple
for you, Kaitlyn,” she says.
Mine will be blue.
She closes the trunk and wraps her arm around my
shoulders. “I'm sorry, Samantha. I tried to order another one
yesterday, but it was too late.”
“That's okay.” I feel my lower lip start to quiver, so I bite
it hard.
“But I have something extra special for you. I want you to
pick out anything you want from the gift shop, okay? And I
mean anything.”
She squeezes my shoulder and takes off, dramatically
gesturing toward the entrance. “Okay, follow me,
everyone.”
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Inside, the spa smells clean, like cucumbers and mint,
and I'm relieved to see another fountain in the corner. I
stand next to it and scratch the back of my neck three
times, until a woman at the front desk calls us over, gives
each of us a fluffy white robe, and assigns us a locker.
I change quickly, text Mom to tell her everything's going
well, and join everyone in the waiting area. We're sipping
cucumber water and whispering about how incredible this
place is, when I hear my name.
Alexis waves at me. “Have fun.”
The aesthetician leads me to a room with peaceful, Zenlike
music and reclines my chair. “I have you booked for our
signature antiaging facial,” she says in a soft voice. “All you
have to do is relax and close your eyes. Tell me if you need
anything.”
I'm not sure how to tell her I'm sixteen and don't need an
antiaging facial, so I stay quiet, even when she starts
chattering about the harmful effects of the sun. Eventually, I
stop fixating on the mistake and let my thoughts drift back
to one of the poems I wrote last night. I repeat it in my
mind, over and over again, until my ninety minutes are up.
As we're all dressing in the locker room, Alexis's mom
announces that we're late for lunch and we need to hurry. A
few minutes later, we're in the car, winding back down the
long driveway and heading into town.
The five of us troop single file along a narrow brick
walkway and up a short staircase to the restaurant. “I knew
this place was really popular, but this…” Mrs. Mazeur looks
overwhelmed as she scans the packed café.
While we wait for her to get our table, Olivia reaches into
her bag and removes her new lotion and passes it around so
we can all try it. Alexis can't stop buzzing about the new
convertible she thinks will be waiting in the driveway when
we get back to her house.
A few minutes later, the hostess tells us to follow her.
She stops at a tiny table with three chairs squeezed around
it.
“There are five of us,” Alexis's mom says.
“The reservation is for two tables, ma'am.”
“And the person I spoke with yesterday assured me the
tables would be together.” The hostess shifts the stack of
menus from one arm to the other, and her eyes dart
nervously around the room. “It's okay,” Mrs. Mazeur says.
“If you could add another chair to this table, I'll sit alone at
the other one.”
“I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't do that. Fire code.”
No one says anything, but after a few uncomfortable
seconds, I feel Mrs. Mazeur thread her arm through mine.
“Want to keep me company?”
“Sure.” I bite the inside of my lip three times. Alexis
doesn't seem to know what to say.
“We're ordering two desserts. Each,” she says to the
group, and when the hostess steps in front of us, we follow
her to the next table.
One. Breathe.
Two. Breathe.
Three. Breathe.
The two of us make small talk for the next twenty
minutes while I try not to stare at my friends laughing and
chatting and waving sympathetically at me from the other
side of the room. When my salad arrives, I awkwardly pick
at it. Finally, I excuse myself to go to the restroom and hide
behind a potted plant out of view, holding back tears as I
text Mom, telling her about my not-so-perfect spa day. She
must sense the panic in my words, because after a bunch of
texts telling me it's not so bad, she says:
Come home.
Then she follows with back-to-back messages:
We'll be out when you get here.
I love you.
You're in control.
Take deep breaths.
I'm in control.
I take some deep breaths and return to my salad.
The car pulls into my driveway and I can't get out fast
enough.
She never wanted me to come.
Alexis tells me she hopes I feel better. Kaitlyn and Olivia
echo her words, yelling out the window as they drive away.
“We'll miss you tonight,” Kaitlyn says.
No you won't.
“We love you,” Olivia adds.
No you don't.
As soon as I close the front door behind me, the tears
start falling and the thoughts flood in faster and faster,
tumbling over each other, pushing themselves to the front,
fighting for my attention.
I shouldn't have gone.
The sun is setting and it's dark and quiet in the entryway.
I slide down to the floor and wrap my arms around my
knees, letting myself cry, allowing the thoughts to come as
fast as they want to. The surrender feels good in a weird
way.
The knock on the door makes me jump.
“Just a minute,” I yell, dashing into the hall bathroom to
check my face. The mascara I carefully applied at the spa is
everywhere but my eyelashes, and my whole face is bright
red and puffy. I clean up as fast as I can and look through
the peephole.
Caroline?
“What are you doing here?” I ask as I open the door, and
immediately regret my words.
Caroline's face falls and she takes two steps backward.
“You invited me over,” she says, flustered. “To watch a
movie. Remember?”
Oh, no.
“It is Saturday night, isn't it?” The lilt in her voice sounds
a little forced. She gives her flannel shirtsleeve a tug and
checks the time on that beat-up watch of hers. “You didn't
tell me when to come by, so I took a chance.” She narrows
her eyes, studying my face. “Hey, what's wrong? Are you
okay?”
Now that I think about it, I am okay. The thoughts are
actually gone, and as far as I can tell, they're not quietly
waiting in the wings, whispering and preparing to pounce
again. They're completely gone.
“Yeah.” I pull the door open so she has room to step
inside, and I voice the only thought in my head. “I'm really
glad you're here.”
She obviously knows that I forgot all about our plans, but
she doesn't call me on it, so I don't say anything either. To
break the tension, I ask her if she wants some water, but
she says she's not thirsty. I ask her if she wants some ice
cream, but she says she's not hungry. It seems a little too
early to start a movie, so I ask her if she wants to come
upstairs to hang out in my room and listen to music. She
doesn't answer, but I start walking toward the stairs and she
follows me.
My room's a mess. I scurry around, scooping up piles of
clothes and stuffing them into the laundry hamper.
“I thought people with OCD were supposed to be neat,”
she says.
“Popular misconception,” I say as I kick all the textbooks
strewn across the floor into a haphazard pile.
“You don't have to clean up for me, you know. You should
see my room. It's a disaster. Stuff everywhere.” I ignore her
and keep picking things up.
Caroline walks around my room, looking at the pictures
on my walls. She stops in front of the collage I made in
eighth grade. THE CRAZY 8S is written across the top in hot
pink, bubbly letters, and pictures spanning more than a
decade are clustered below.
“Wow. You've known your friends for a long time,”
Caroline says as I'm docking my phone. I start my In the
Deep playlist. My nerves are still a little rattled.
I walk over and join her. She gestures to the poster. “Do
you want to tell me what happened today?” she says, as if
she knows my red eyes and puffy face had something to do
with my friends.
“How do you know something happened?”
“I have a knack for reading people,” she says casually.
“Here, look into my eyes and think of a number. Not three.” I
look at her funny but fix my eyes on hers and think about
the number nine. Caroline stares back. And then a huge
smile forms across her face. “I'm just messing with you. I
was only two houses away when your friend's mom pulled
into your driveway.”
I feel like an idiot. Caroline laughs and takes a couple of
steps backward until she reaches my bed. She drops back
on my comforter and rests her weight on her hands, legs
crossed in front of her. I read her T-shirt: FREE SHRUGS.
“So what happened today?”
She looks like she genuinely wants to hear the story. And
I definitely want to talk about it. If Mom were here, we'd be
downstairs on the couch eating ice cream straight out of the
carton while I spilled every detail. I flop down on the
opposite side of the bed, mimicking Caroline's pose.
“Today was Alexis's birthday.”
“Alexis? The little Barbie one? Wears high heels, like,
every day?” I nod. It's funny to hear how other people see
her.
Then I fill her in on the details of the spa day I wasn't
originally invited to. I tell her about the drive and the sound
of the fountain and the smell of flowers on the breeze, but
when I get to the part about the personalized bags, my
chest feels tight. I pull at a loose thread on the pant leg of
my jeans.
“It's dumb, right? I shouldn't be upset. It was last
minute…” I let my words hang in the air as I check
Caroline's reaction. She doesn't say anything, but her face
scrunches up and I can tell she doesn't think I'm dumb at
all.
“Her mom obviously felt bad,” I continue. “She said I
could pick anything I wanted from the gift shop.”
“I hope you picked something ridiculously expensive.”
I shake my head. “After our appointments were finished,
we were running late and she rushed us off to lunch.”
Caroline bites her lip.
“But, hey, on the bright side, look at my skin.” I lean in a
little closer. “Don't I look ten years younger?”
She leans in too. “You're asking me if you look like you're
six?” I laugh, and Caroline joins in. “I hope lunch was
better.”
“Worse.”
She stops laughing. “How is that possible?”
“When her mom called the restaurant to change the
reservation from four people to five, they told her we had to
be at separate tables. I guess she assumed they'd push
them together or something.”
“No.”
“Yep. It was a French restaurant with these tiny café
tables—”
“Wait, so you sat with your friend's mom while everyone
else sat together at another table?” I'm glad I didn't have to
say it out loud. I have a feeling it still wouldn't be funny.
I cross my arms. I faked a headache to come home early,
but now I feel a real one coming on with the retelling. “I'm
overreacting, right?”
As I wait for her response, I study her eyes. They're
narrow and hooded, but I'm no longer trying to figure out
how to apply eye shadow to open them up. They're pretty
the way they are. Her hair doesn't seem so stringy either,
and I'm not dying to cover up her blemishes. I'm just happy
she's here.
“You're not overreacting,” she says.
“Are you sure? Because you can tell me if I am. I have a
tendency to overthink things, especially when it comes to
my friends, and I don't know…I take things too personally. I
mean, it isn't always them. Sometimes it's me. I just don't
always know when it's them and when it's me, you know?”
I'm not sure if that made sense, but Caroline's looking at
me like she understood it perfectly. It's like I can read her
mind right now. She doesn't like that my friends hurt my
feelings, intentionally or not. Whether it's them or me, she
doesn't understand why I'd choose to hang around with
people I'm constantly questioning. And she's sad for me,
because my closest friends don't feel all that close anymore,
not like they did when we were those kids on that poster
hanging on my wall.
I picture the people I saw in Poet's Corner that day. “You
don't ever wonder what your friends think about you, do
you?”
Caroline doesn't answer, but she doesn't have to. I can
tell I'm right by the look on her face.
“You're lucky,” I say.
I stare down at my feet, thinking about how I spent last
night tucked down in my bed with a flashlight, writing
horrible poetry into the early morning hours, waking up
feeling drained but euphoric at the same time. I've been
thinking about those poems all day. I couldn't wait to get
home to write again.
When I look up, I find Caroline staring at me.
“What?” I ask.
A cautious smile spreads across her lips. “Let me hear
one.”
I look at her like I have no idea what she's talking about,
but I'm pretty sure I do. “One what?” I can hear the anxiety
in my own voice.
“A poem.”
How does she know I've been writing poetry?
“Read me something from the blue notebook.”
My head snaps up and my jaw drops.
How does she know about the colors?
She points over at my nightstand, and I twist in place, my
eyes following the invisible line that leads from her fingertip
to the stack of three notebooks—red, yellow, and blue—
piled underneath the lamp.
“You're writing, aren't you?” she asks.
I don't answer her directly, but I don't have to. She can
probably tell she's right by the panicked look on my face. I
can't read my poetry to her. I can't read it to anyone.
Shrink-Sue told me I didn't have to share anything I wrote in
those books. I wouldn't have written it if I thought
otherwise.
“Is it really dark?” she continues. “It's okay if it is. My
stuff can get pretty dark, too.”
“No, it's not dark; it's…stupid.”
“My stuff can get pretty stupid, too. I won't make fun of
you, I promise.”
“I can't.”
“Read me your favorite. Don't think about it, just go.
Read.”
I laugh. “You're telling me to not think. All I do is think. All
the time. I think so much, I'm on medication and I see a
shrink every Wednesday. I can't not think, Caroline.”
“Sam.”
“What?”
“Go.”
I have the perfect one in mind. It's short. I can read it
without throwing up. Besides, I kind of like it. And I don't
even need my blue notebook because these words have
been stuck in my head all day, during my ridiculous facial
and in the car after we left the spa and during lunch. They
joined the mantras. They kept the destructive thoughts from
invading.
I sit up again. My hands are shaking, so I tuck them
under my legs as I take a deep breath, close my eyes, and
say, “It's called ‘The Drop.'”
Standing on the platform.
Sun sinking into my skin.
This water will cover me like a blanket.
And I'll be safe again.
She doesn't laugh, but the room is completely silent. I
open my eyes and look at her, waiting for a reaction.
She hated it.
“We have to get you back downstairs,” Caroline finally
says, and I can hear the sincerity in her voice, can see it in
her face.
She liked it.
I stare at her, wondering if she's too good to be true.
Where did she come from? Why is she being so nice to me?
“That'll never happen,” I tell her plainly. “That
‘keymaster' guy hates me. He won't even look at me.”
I picture him on that stool and his song starts playing in
my head. I think about the words and where they live on
that wall. If I could get back downstairs, I could find his
lyrics. I'll commit them to memory next time.
“That's just AJ,” she says, giving a dismissive shake of
her head. “And he doesn't hate you. But you hurt him, and
he doesn't know how to handle that.”
“What?” My thoughts stop cold. “Hurt him? What are you
talking about?”
She looks right at me but doesn't say a word.
“Caroline. How did I hurt him? I don't even know him.”
“Yes, you do.”
I remember how he stood in front of me, blocking my
way into Poet's Corner the other day. He looked familiar, but
I've never known anyone named AJ, and he's cute enough,
especially with that dimple and that adorable guitar-playing
thing of his, that I would have remembered him if we'd met
before.
“Are you going to tell me?”
She shakes her head. “You'll figure it out.”
I stare at her in disbelief. “I don't want to figure it out,
Caroline. I want you to tell me.” That might have sounded
bitchy. I didn't mean it to, but I can't believe she's holding
out on me.
She checks her watch. “I have to go.” She hops off the
bed and starts walking toward the door.
“What about the movie?”
“Maybe another time,” she says as she reaches for the
doorknob.
My mind is leaping around from thought to thought, like
it can't settle on one.
I hurt him. And Caroline's leaving. But she likes my
poem. I like talking to her. I don't want her to leave.
“It's okay,” I say. “You don't have to tell me. Please…
stay.”
It's killing me not to know what I did, but there are plenty
of other things I want to talk to her about. I want to ask her
about all the poets. I want to know about that room and how
it got there and how it works, and I want her to read me
some of her poems. I want to be her friend.
She turns around and looks at me. I hurry over to my
nightstand, grab the blue notebook from the pile, and hold it
up in the air. “I want to get back to Poet's Corner, but I don't
know how to. Will you help me?”
Mom's buttering toast for Paige, drinking her coffee, and
replying to a message on her cell phone, when she says,
“Do you want to talk about what happened yesterday?”
“Nah. I'm good.” I down my orange juice. “I talked to my
friend Caroline last night.”
Mom's typing again. “Who's Caroline?” she asks without
looking up.
“Just someone I met at school. She's nice. She came over
after I got home from the spa.”
Now I have her attention.
“Really?” Her eyes grow wide.
I try to act nonchalant about the whole thing, like this
happens all the time, but then I picture Caroline sitting on
the floor in my room, helping me with my poetry, and I feel
a little bit giddy. “Yeah, I would have introduced you, but she
had to leave before you guys got home.”
“Have you told Sue about her?”
“Yep.” I grab the toast with one hand and punch Paige
lightly on the arm with the other. “I'm going to the pool.”
The next day, Olivia and I are walking to Trigonometry when
I see AJ heading right for us. I almost didn't notice him—I
probably wouldn't have if the dark ski hat hadn't caught my
eye—because he's looking down at the ground and keeping
pace with everyone else. He walks right by me.
Caroline's words have haunted me since Saturday night:
“He doesn't hate you, but you hurt him.” I can't figure out
what I did, and somewhere around two thirty this morning, I
decided I was going to find out the first chance I got.
“I left my trig book in my locker,” I say to Olivia. “I'll
meet you at class.”
She waves me off and I do a 180 and start following the
ski cap heading in the opposite direction. AJ turns the corner
and stops at a locker. Keeping my distance, I watch as he
rests his backpack on one knee and swaps out his books.
When he sees me, he tilts his chin in my direction. “Hey.”
No smile. No wave. Just the chin tilt. He swings his locker
door closed.
“Hi.” I gesture toward the main corridor. “I saw you in the
hall, but…I guess you didn't see me.”
He shakes his head.
“I wanted to say hello.” I dig my fingernails into the back
of my neck. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two,
three. “And, you know, say thank you…for letting me join
you guys last week.”
AJ checks the area around us and steps in closer. He's a
full head taller than me, and when he tucks his chin to his
chest and stares down at me, I feel guilty, even though I
haven't done anything wrong. His eyebrows lift accusingly.
“You haven't told anyone, have you?”
“Of course not. I wouldn't do that.”
He's still close. He's still staring at me like he's trying to
decide if I'm telling the truth. I square my shoulders and
straighten my spine. “I told you I wouldn't, and I haven't.”
“Good,” he says. Another long pause. “Don't.”
“I won't.”
He steps out of my personal space and I have a chance
to look at him. Really look at him. His dark blond hair is
poking out from under the cap, and his eyes are this
interesting brownish-green that's almost the same color as
the T-shirt he's wearing. He's not clean-cut, like most of my
guy friends. He's scruffier, but in a sexy way. I try to read
the expression on his face, but I can't, and it bothers me
because there's something about the way he's looking at
me right now that makes me feel sorry for him. He looks
sweet, maybe even shy, and nothing like the confident guy I
watched perform on that stage last week.
The questions are spinning in my head, and I want to spit
them out and get it over with. How do I know you? How did I
hurt you? How do I tell you I'm sorry if I have no idea what I
did? But I push the words down, searching for new, safer
ones.
“I really loved your song. It's kind of been stuck in my
head.”
He takes another step back. “Thanks,” he says.
“I've been trying to remember all the lyrics, but…”
Invite me back. Please.
I look around again to be sure there's no one within
earshot. “That day downstairs, I guess it kind of inspired me.
My poems aren't very good or anything.” I pause for a
moment, waiting for him to say something, but he doesn't,
so I keep blabbering.
“I barely slept last weekend.” Now he looks at me
sideways like he's trying to figure out why this is his
problem. “I haven't been…” I stop short, realizing I was
about to admit that I haven't been taking the prescription
sleep meds I've popped every night for the last five years. I
keep forgetting. Or maybe I don't forget. Maybe I make a
choice to keep writing despite how exhausted I'll be the
next day. “I haven't been sleeping. Once I start writing, I
kind of need to keep going.” I let a nervous laugh escape.
The corners of his mouth turn up slightly. Not much, but
enough to expose that dimple and catch me off guard.
“You're writing?”
I nod.
“You?” AJ crosses his arms like he doesn't believe me, but
at least now I can read the look on his face. He's surprised.
Maybe even intrigued. “You're writing poetry, and not
because you have to for a class?”
I shrug. I think he expects me to be offended, but I'm not.
I get it. The whole poetry thing shocks me, too.
“Of course, it's total crap,” I say, hoping more selfcriticism
will elicit some kind of reaction, like an invitation to
come downstairs and say those words on stage so they can
pelt me with paper and, later, glue sticks.
AJ uncrosses his arms and transfers his backpack from
one shoulder to the other. “I bet your poems are better than
you think they are.”
It's not true, but it's a nice thing to say and he looks like
he means it. I start to reply, but then I look past him, over
his right shoulder, and see Kaitlyn walking in our direction,
taking measured steps, hanging back like she's timing her
arrival so she doesn't interrupt the two of us.
Invite me back. I want to hear more poetry, more of your
songs.
“I've got to get to class,” he says. “I'll see ya later,
okay?”
And with that, he takes off, leaving Kaitlyn the opening
she was waiting for. She lengthens her stride and as soon as
she's close enough, she grabs me by the arm with both
hands. “Holy shit, was that Andrew Olsen?” she asks.
“Who?”
She lets go of me so she can point at him, and together,
we watch AJ open a classroom door and disappear from
sight. “That was him! God, we were so brutal to that kid,
weren't we?” She shakes her head as I turn his name over in
my mind. Andrew Olsen. Andrew Olsen.
“Who?” I ask again, and she slaps my arm with the back
of her hand.
“Andrew Olsen. Remember? Fourth grade. Mrs. Collins's
class?” Kaitlyn must be able to tell by the look on my face
that I'm not connecting the dots, because she breaks into
this huge grin. She shakes her hips and sings, “A-A-AAndrew…”
to the tune of the Chia Pet jingle, and then she
starts cracking up.
“How can you not remember Andrew? That kid stuttered
so badly he couldn't even say his name. We used to follow
him around singing that song.…You have to remember this!”
Oh, God. I do. It's all starting to come back to me, and
when she sings that horrible song again, I can see Kaitlyn
and me in our skirts and ponytails, trailing behind him on
the playground while he covered his ears, tears streaming
down his face, trying to run away from us. We never let him
get far.
“Andrew?” That's all I can get out. I want to throw up.
Andrew. That's what Caroline meant.
“Remember? We even made him cry on that field trip to
the museum? His mom had to come all the way into the city
to pick him up.”
I don't want to remember, but I do. I remember
everything. How it all started. How it finally ended.
Kaitlyn singled him out early on. Eventually, I joined in.
We teased him at every recess, during lunch, after school
when he was waiting for the bus. We looked for him—looked
forward to finding him. I can even picture his face when he
saw us coming, and I remember how it made me feel guilty,
but not guilty enough to stop, because it also made me feel
powerful in a weird way. And there was always a look of
approval on Kaitlyn's face.
When school started the following year, we found out
he'd transferred, and Kaitlyn and I were actually
disappointed, as if our favorite toy had been permanently
taken away from us. I never thought I'd see him again. I'm
sure he hoped he'd never see Kaitlyn and me again, but I
assume he didn't have a choice since this is the only public
high school in the area.
Caroline was wrong. He hates me.
Kaitlyn stops talking, but I guess the horrified look on my
face doesn't register with her, because she's still lit up as if
this whole thing is hilarious.
“So why were you talking to him?” She pops her hip and
plays with her necklace while she waits for me to answer.
It takes me a second to pull it together. When I finally do
speak, my voice is shaking and the words come out in
fragmented whispers. “We have a class together.” Does
Poet's Corner count as a class? Probably not.
“He was in my P.E. class last year,” she says, “but we
didn't have to talk much, so I never got to hear him. Does
he still stutter?”
I picture the way he stepped on stage and perched
himself on that stool. How he threw his guitar over his
shoulder and stated that his song sucked, beaming as he
gestured toward his chest, confidently inviting his friends to
throw things at him. He sang and his words were beautiful
and clear, not broken in any way. Nothing about him was
broken.
“No, he doesn't.”
He's long gone, but Kaitlyn points in his direction. “See,
we fixed him,” she says proudly. My cheeks feel hot, and
when she elbows me, laughing, my hands ball into fists by
my side. “You know what they say, ‘That which does not kill
us makes us stronger.'”
I'm unable to speak or breathe or move. I can't believe
she just said that, and I know I should defend him, but I'm
frozen in place, totally stunned. Saying nothing, as usual.
“Besides,” she continues, “that was a million years ago.
We were little kids. I bet he doesn't even remember us.” I
feel a huge, uncomfortable lump in my throat. How could I
do that do him? To anyone?
“He remembers,” I say under my breath as I walk away.
Caroline's at her locker after last bell, and I stall, waiting for
everyone to clear out. When the coast is finally clear, I race
over to her.
“I know what I did to AJ.” My stomach turns over as I say
it. “No wonder he doesn't want me downstairs. Caroline,
what do I do?”
“You can start by apologizing,” she says.
He'll never forgive me. How could he?
“He must think I'm a horrible person.”
Maybe he's right. Maybe I am.
“Do you want my help?”
I nod. Caroline turns on her heel and gestures for me to
follow her. “Come on,” she says. “I know what to do.”
She leads me to the first row of the theater and we spend
the next three hours working on a single poem. I write.
Caroline listens. When I get stuck, she feeds me word after
word until we find the perfect one that sums up what I want
him to know. When I'm done, we have a poem that doesn't
say “I'm sorry” in so many words, but it talks about regret
and second chances, a fear of not belonging that runs so
deep it changes you into someone you don't want to be. It's
about seeing what you've become and wanting—craving—to
be someone different. Someone better.
It's me, asking him to let me in. Asking all of them to give
me a chance to show them that, deep down, I'm not who
they think I am. Or, maybe I'm exactly who they think I am,
but I no longer want to be.
Fifteen minutes into lunch, I start stuffing empty wrappers
back into my lunch bag, collecting my trash, and brushing
the grass off my pants. “I have to go to the library and get
this book for English,” I announce. “Anyone want to come?” I
already know they'll pass.
“I'm not allowed in there,” Olivia says proudly.
Kaitlyn laughs. “How the hell do you get banned from the
school library?”
Olivia rolls her eyes. “Mrs. Rasmussen caught Travis and
me making out in the biography section. It's around that
corner, you know?” she says, drawing an imaginary curve in
the air with her hand. “It's completely out of view. What else
are you supposed to do over there?” She giggles.
“Look for biographies,” Hailey suggests.
“Nah. Boring.” Olivia sits up a little straighter, eyes
darting around the circle, enjoying the attention. “Trust me,
it was worth getting kicked out. Travis may not be the
sharpest tool in the shed, but that boy can kiss.”
We all laugh.
“I wonder what he's doing this weekend?” Olivia adds as
she reaches for her phone.
“I thought you broke up because you two didn't have
anything to talk about,” Alexis says.
“We don't.” She crinkles her nose. “I'm not planning to
talk to him,” she says, cocking her head to the side and
continuing to search for his number.
Kaitlyn pulls a piece of bread from her sandwich and
chucks it at Olivia's head.
I mutter a quick “See ya,” and head off for the path that
leads to the theater. I know exactly where to go—I've
pictured those stairs and that narrow hallway in my mind a
hundred times now—and soon I'm inside the janitor's closet,
pulling the mops and brooms to the side to reveal the
concealed seam and the black bolt. Their voices are
muffled, like they're far away, and I knock lightly, three
times. The sound stops immediately.
I hear the key slip into the lock and the dead bolt click. AJ
cracks the door open, just wide enough to see me. “You've
got to be kidding.”
Ignoring his comment, I come up on my tiptoes, looking
over his shoulder, searching for Caroline. She's part of
today's plan. I come downstairs and she tries to convince
him to let me in so I can read the poem we wrote.
“I'm looking for—” I start to say her name, but AJ opens
the door and steps forward, and I have no choice but to step
back inside the janitor's closet. That stupid Chia Pet jingle
pops into my head.
What the hell's wrong with me?
He closes the door and uses that key around his neck to
lock it behind him. “What, are you on some kind of twisted
quest or something? Did your friends put you up to this?” He
walks over to the door that connects the janitor's closet to
the hallway and peers out, looking for my accomplices.
I was expecting him to be surprised, but not quite so
pissed. My hands start shaking and my legs feel like they're
going to give out, but I force myself to stand tall and look
right into his eyes like Caroline told me to.
“I have something I'd really like to read to you. To all of
you.” I pull the poem from the pocket of my jeans and open
it wide so he can see the proof.
He walks toward me, laughing. “It doesn't work that way,
Samantha.”
“How does it work?”
He brings his hands to his hips. “It works like this:
Members read. Members listen. Non-members do not read
or listen, because they aren't allowed inside. Look, I made
an exception, but I told you, one time.”
“Can't I just—”
He cuts me off. “You need to go.”
“Why?”
“Because,” he says, “you don't belong here.”
My heart sinks. I fold my poem along the creases and
stuff it back into my pocket. “Why not?”
His gaze travels around the room, like he's searching for
words, but he won't find any on these walls. There's nothing
but cleaning supplies in here.
Finally he locks his eyes on mine, and he doesn't say a
thing, but I understand completely. He told me the first time
I was down here. We're not friends.
I reach into my pocket, removing the folded piece of
paper again. I press it into his palm and close his fingers
around it. “I didn't remember at first. It was years ago.…I
don't know, maybe I blocked it out or something. But
anyway, I know what I did now, and I am so sorry. I'll never
be able to tell you how much I regret it. But I'm truly,
genuinely sorry. And mortified.” Some weird sound escapes,
and I cover my mouth. “But I deserve to be, right?”
I turn to leave, hoping he'll stop me. He doesn't.
As I'm about to step into the hallway, I glance over my
shoulder. AJ is already back inside Poet's Corner. When I
hear the bolt click into place, I return to the door and rest
my ear against it.
I can hear their voices on the other side. I feel tears
pricking my eyes when I think about Sydney standing on
stage, making everyone laugh, and AJ singing, giving
everyone chills. I'm curious about Caroline. She said it would
be easy to get me inside, as long as we found the right
words. She was wrong. Maybe she's up there right now,
pleading my case since I can't do it myself. I picture that
room. Its tactile walls. All those colorful slips of paper and
incredible words I'll never see again.
I climb the stairs, cross the stage, and step out into the
sunshine, taking deep deliberate breaths like Shrink-Sue
taught me to. By the time I arrive at our tree, I'm under
control again.
“Where's your library book?” Hailey asks as I sit down,
rejoining the circle.
“It was already checked out,” I tell her.
I pluck at the blades of grass—one, two, three—and look
around at Alexis, Kaitlyn, Olivia, and Hailey, thinking about
Sue's advice to make new friends, and realizing that after all
those years of saying I couldn't do it, I just tried to. And
failed.
“Fill me in,” Sue says. “How are things with your friends
this week?”
I stretch the putty between my fingers, testing to see
how far I can pull it before it snaps. “Better in some ways.
But different.”
“Do you mean they're treating you differently?”
I kind of wish they were. That would be easier. “No. It's
more…the other way around.”
It's been a month since I tried to give AJ my poem. Ever
since that day, something's shifted in me. I'm quieter during
lunch. Last Saturday night, I skipped a party and went to the
movies with my family instead. I've been hanging out with
Paige after school, taking her to gymnastics practice,
helping her with her homework. I'm having a hard time
being around the Eights. I can't even look at Kaitlyn. Every
time I do, I think of that smug look on her face when she
said we “cured” AJ, and I feel sick.
I kick off my shoes and pull my feet onto the chair,
curling myself into a ball. “I don't feel like talking about
them today. Can we change the subject?” I ask, resting my
chin on my knees.
“Of course. What do you want to talk about?”
I glance over at the clock. I've spent the week obsessing
about sitting in this chair, talking to Sue, hearing her advice,
playing with my putty. Now I'm here and I have no idea what
I want to say.
“I've been swimming every day. I'm feeling good about
that. I can tell I'm getting stronger, and it's taking my mind
off, well, everything. And I've been writing a lot. It's
cathartic, you know? It makes me feel…” I search for the
right word, something Sue will like, and settle on, “Healthy.”
“Hmm. I like that word. Healthy.” She says it slowly,
letting it linger in the air for a while. I feel a pang of guilt
when I picture myself huddled under the covers with a
flashlight, writing until late night becomes early morning.
This probably isn't the best time to tell her I haven't been
taking my sleep meds.
“How are things with Caroline?” she asks. As soon as I
hear her name, I feel my shoulders sink a little lower.
“Good. We've been spending a lot of time together. We
meet in the theater after school and she helps me with my
poetry.” God, if the Eights overheard me say that, I'd never
hear the end of it, but Sue clearly isn't one of them, because
she rests her elbows on the armrest and leans forward to
keep me talking.
“I like writing with her. When I can't figure out how to
articulate what I want to say, she seems to have the perfect
words. And we talk, you know? Really talk about things.” I
shift in my chair, squeeze my putty into a tight ball. “The
Eights and I used to talk like that, but we haven't in a long
time. It feels kind of…strange to have a friend like that
again.”
“But good strange.”
“Yeah. Definitely good strange.”
My fingers work the putty while Sue settles back in her
chair and consults her notes, flipping back to earlier pages,
previous sessions.
“We haven't talked about Brandon in a while. Are you still
thinking about him?”
Brandon? Wow. Now that I think about it, I haven't given
him much thought in the last month. “No. Not really.”
She writes it down. “How about Kurt?”
“Kurt? Ew. No.” I saw him at lunch today, but that didn't
even prompt me to think about him in the way Sue's
referring to.
“Are you thinking about any other boys?”
“You mean, Am I obsessing about any other boys?”
“Not necessarily. Unless that's what it feels like to you.”
I grin at her. “Nice spin.”
Sue cocks her head to one side, looking smug.
I haven't talked to AJ since I gave him my apology poem
and he kicked me out of Poet's Corner, but I think about that
day a lot. I think about him a lot. I changed the route I take
to third period so I'm more likely to cross paths with him. I
write about him almost every night before I fall asleep. I was
up late last night making a playlist of acoustic guitar songs I
could imagine him playing and titled it Song for You.
I've figured out where he lives, but I've fought the urge
to drive by his house. I know where he eats lunch when he's
not downstairs—I've seen him sitting at the round table over
by the bathrooms with that other guy and one of the girls
from Poet's Corner—but I don't stare at him or intentionally
drop objects as I walk by or anything.
I picture his dimple and that sexy, fluid way he throws his
guitar over his back. But then I think about the look on his
face when he told me I didn't belong in Poet's Corner, and
reality hits. I'm not sure I'm obsessed with him, but I'm
definitely obsessed with him forgiving me. And I'm curious
about him. Caroline knows. Sue would probably want me to
tell her, too.
“No, I'm not obsessed with any boys,” I say.
She raises her eyebrows, looking at me like she knows
me far too well to believe it. I'm not offended. I've been
preoccupied with guys since the day she met me.
“But I can't stop thinking about AJ. The boy Kaitlyn and I
teased when we were kids.” I rest my forehead on my
knees, hiding my face.
“You've apologized to him, haven't you?” she asks. I nod
without looking at her.
But I can't undo what I did.
I let out a heavy sigh. “When am I going to stop making
mistakes, Sue?”
Her laugh catches me off guard, and I look up at her,
wide-eyed and confused. “Why on earth would you want to
do that?” she asks.
I stare at her.
“Mistakes. Trial and error. Same thing. Mistakes are how
we learned to walk and run and that hot things burn when
you touch them. You've made mistakes all your life and
you're going to keep making them.”
“Terrific.”
“The trick is to recognize your mistakes, take what you
need from them, and move on.”
“I can't move on.”
“You can't beat yourself up, either.”
The room is quiet for a long time. Finally she clears her
throat to get my attention. “Why are you scratching?” she
asks. I hadn't even realized I was doing it, and when I pull
my fingers away, the back of my neck feels sore and raw. I
smash my thumb into my putty.
“I need him to forgive me,” I say.
It's all I think about. It's making me crazy.
“You can't need that, Sam,” she says, slowly shaking her
head. “That one's out of your control. You've done your part,
and now it's up to him. He'll either forgive you or he won't.”
He won't.
I haven't let myself cry over what Kaitlyn and I did to AJ—
not when I found out, not when I told Sue a month ago—but
I can't hold back the tears anymore, so I let them fall. My
chest already feels lighter with the release.
“Hey,” Sue says, resting her elbows on her knees. “Look
at me. You're a good person who made a mistake.” That
makes me cry even harder. “Did you learn something?”
I hide my face behind my hand, nodding fast.
“Then this particular mistake has done its job. Forgive
yourself and move on, Sam.” When Sue hands me a tissue,
my eyes meet hers. “Go for it,” she says quietly.
I'm not sure how long I sit there wiping my eyes and
blowing my nose, but I know even if we go overtime on our
session today, there's no way she'll let me leave this chair
until I say it. And mean it.
“I forgive myself,” I finally say, my voice cracking on
each word.
As I take my seat in history class, I check the clock on the
wall. I still have a few minutes before the bell rings, so I pull
out my yellow notebook. I've been thinking about mistakes
and forgiveness ever since my session with Sue yesterday,
and I'm dying to add a few more lines to my poem on the
topic.
“Hey, Sam.” I slam my notebook shut and look up.
Sydney is hovering over me.
“Hi. Sydney, right?” I ask, as if I don't know her name.
But of course I do. I've seen her every day during fourth
period for the past month, and each time, I think about her
Chicken McNuggets poem and smile to myself.
She rests one hand on my desk and reaches for my silver
S pendant with the other. “Ooh, I love this,” she says, lifting
it into her fingers. She twists it around a few times, studying
it from various angles. She drops it and reaches for her own
necklace. “Look. We have excellent taste in letters,” she
says, holding up a hot pink letter S.
“That's really pretty,” I tell her, still trying to figure out
why she's talking to me.
“So,” she whispers, “AJ read your poem to us.”
“What? When?” I gave it to him so long ago. I figured if
he'd read it, I would have known by now. It's been all I can
do to stop thinking about it.
“We've been talking,” she says. “We want you to come
back.”
“Really?”
“Really.” She bends down toward my ear. “Some of us
wanted you to come back the following week. Some of us
took more convincing.”
“AJ?” I ask.
“He wasn't alone in his opinion. We all know who you are,
Samantha. We remember what you did to him,” she says. I
hunch my shoulders and tuck my head to my chest, wishing
I could disappear. “But I think you meant what you said in
that poem. Did you?”
It takes effort, but I sit up straight and look right at her.
“Every last word.”
“Good. We're meeting at lunch today. Come downstairs
with me after class.” She taps my yellow notebook. “Bring
this with you,” she says. Then she continues down the aisle
and takes her seat a few rows behind me.
Holy shit.
My mind is racing and I can't lock on to one thought. I'm
still embarrassed, but now elation is starting to take over. I
get to see that room again. But then I think about how
Sydney tapped on my notebook, and I start to panic.
I'll have to read a poem.
Class starts, but I'm not really paying attention. All I can
think about are the poems I've written so far. I swap out my
yellow notebook for the blue one and start thumbing
through the pages, looking for worthy candidates as I dig
my fingernails into the back of my neck three times, again
and again.
Horrible. Lame. Ridiculous. Supposed to be funny but
isn't. Supposed to rhyme but doesn't. Hmm, this one's kind
of poignant—but…haiku?
Sweat is forming on my brow, and I keep shifting in my
chair, and my neck already feels sore from all the
scratching. Maybe I'll have time to ask Caroline for her
opinion. She's heard every one of these poems. She helped
me write many of them.
Wait. This one's worth considering.
I look up at the whiteboard to check the status of the
lesson and pretend to take a few notes, but when the coast
is clear I read the poem. Then I turn around and look at
Sydney. She's watching me with wide eyes and an
encouraging smile, and it reminds me of Caroline's words
that very first day: “I'm going to show you something that
will change your whole life.”
Sydney's chatty, and that's good because I can't breathe,
let alone speak. As we weave our way through the doors,
down the stairs, and around the tight corners, I listen to her
talk about her plans for the upcoming weekend, and I
mutter a few “uh-huhs” sprinkled with some “that sounds
like funs,” but I'm not really hearing a word she's saying. I
was feeling so confident once I found a poem to read, but
apparently I left that emotion back in the classroom.
Now, it's all hitting me. As soon as I get through that
door, they'll all expect me to get on stage and let
meaningful words emerge from my mouth. I can't do that. I
can't even speak when I'm sitting on a patch of grass next
to people I've known my entire life. The air must be thicker
down here or maybe the ventilation in the basement doesn't
work as well as it should, because I. Can't. Breathe.
Sydney knocks hard on the door that leads inside and we
wait. My fingernails find their usual spot and dig in. Hard.
This is a mistake.
The bolt clicks and the door squeaks as it opens, and
there's AJ, key in hand. “Hi,” he says.
Sydney pulls the door open. Once we're in the room, she
spreads her arms wide. “Where do you want to sit?”
I scan the room. The African American girl with the long
black braids is resting her knee on one of the couches,
talking and waving her arms animatedly, like she's telling a
funny story. The girl with the super curly blond hair and the
short guy in the artsy glasses are watching her, laughing
along.
On the far end of the room, I spot pixie-cut girl, Abigail.
She looks different today, eyes thickly lined in a dramatic
cat's-eye, and lips painted dark red. She wears it well.
Confidently. Her arm is propped against the back of the
couch, and she's chatting with that girl with the short dark
hair and the small silver nose ring.
I don't see Caroline anywhere.
“Give me a minute, would you?” I say to Sydney as I
point at AJ. She gets the message.
He bolts the door and then turns around to face me. He
doesn't look angry. He doesn't look upset. He doesn't look
anything.
“Listen,” I say. “I can go if you're uncomfortable with this.
I'm…” What's the word? Conflicted? Selfish? “I'm wondering
if I should be here. I mean, if you don't want me to be.”
He doesn't say anything at first. But then he gestures
toward the others. “They want to hear what you have to
say.”
I don't have anything to say.
“I guess I want to hear what you have to say, too,” AJ
adds.
Now this feels less like an invitation to join the group and
more like a test I need to pass. I write shitty poetry. For
myself. I don't have anything to say.
“I'm not sure I'm ready for this.” The words come out
before I can stop them. My breathing becomes shallow
again, and my whole body feels like it's on fire. My hands
are clammy, my fingers tingly, and the thoughts start
rushing in, one after the other.
Everyone's going to laugh at me.
“Are you okay?” AJ asks, and without even thinking about
it, I shake my head.
“Where's Car—” My throat goes dry before I can get her
name out. I wrap my hand around my neck, and AJ takes my
arm, leading me to one of the couches in the back row. “Sit
down. I'll get you some water,” he says. I rest my elbows on
my knees and fix my gaze on the black painted floor.
It's just a thought.
I feel a hand on my back, and I turn my head to the side,
expecting to see AJ, but it's Caroline. “Hey, it's okay,” she
says. As quickly as it began, the thought spiral starts to
slow.
“Caroline,” I whisper.
“I'm right here,” she says. “It's okay.”
I can't break down in front of them. I don't want to be
someone who breaks down.
“Is everyone looking at us?” I ask.
“Nope. No one's paying any attention. Just breathe.”
I listen to her. I do what I'm told.
A few seconds later, AJ returns to my other side with a
cup of water. “Here,” he says. I take it without looking at
him, and drink it with my eyes closed. I imagine him and
Caroline silently communicating above my head.
I'm in control. I can do this.
Instead of my own destructive thoughts, I now hear Sue's
voice in my head, telling me this is good. That this is
something Summer Sam might do. That she's proud of me.
Without letting another negative thought creep in, I bend
down, unzip my backpack, and remove my blue notebook.
“I'm ready,” I say quietly, and I stand up tall, feigning
confidence.
“What are you doing?” AJ asks.
“Reading.”
“Sam—”
I cut him off. “No. It's okay.”
I'm finally down here, and this is what they do when
they're down here. If I'm going to prove I belong, I need to
get up on that stage and show them I'm not just one of the
Crazy Eights. I'm just me.
“Watch for today, Sam.” AJ motions toward the rest of the
group, sitting, waiting to start. “Please.” But I'm already
pushing past him, making my way to the stage.
Stepping onto the platform doesn't require any physical
effort—it's two feet off the floor at best—but it does call for
a heavy dose of forced enthusiasm. I scoot onto the stool
and sit up straight. The chatter dies immediately.
I'm sure everyone can see my legs shaking.
“Hi,” I say to the group, waving my little blue notebook in
the air. “I've been writing a lot of poetry lately, but I'm really
new at this.” I choose my words carefully. Even if I said my
stuff sucked, I doubt they'd actually pelt me with paper balls
on my first visit, but I don't really want to test them on it.
“So, be nice, okay?”
Sydney opens her mouth like she's about to say
something. The others are silently watching me, shifting in
place, looking at one another, and I can't help but feel as if
I've done something wrong. I find AJ and Caroline at the
back of the room. I can't read either one of their
expressions.
Keep going.
I open my notebook to the page I dog-eared back in
class. “This is called ‘Plunge,'” I say.
I take a deep breath.
“Three steps up,” I begin. But then I stop, giving myself a
second to skim the rest of the poem. It looks different than it
did back in U.S. History. Everything's right here. My
obsession with threes. My scratching habit. My parking
ritual. How I can't sleep.
This poem isn't about the pool at all. It's about the crazy.
My crazy. All here, spilled in ink. Suddenly, I feel more like a
stripper than a poet, two minutes away from exposing
myself to these total strangers who may think I'm plastic,
but don't currently think I'm nuts.
Shit. Here they come again.
The negative thoughts overpower all the positive ones,
and the familiar swirl begins. But this time, the thoughts
aren't about standing on stage and reading out loud and
wondering if everyone's going to laugh at me. These
thoughts are much worse.
They'll know I'm sick.
I wanted to believe that I could get up on this stage and
drop my guard like AJ and Sydney did so easily, but now I'm
not so sure anymore. They're all watching me, and I look at
each of their faces, realizing that I know nothing about
them. I don't even know most of their names.
“Three steps up…” I repeat, softer this time. My whole
body is shaking and my palms are clammy. My stomach
cramps into a tight knot and I feel like I'm about to throw
up.
I stand, preparing to bolt from the stage, but then
something catches my eye at the back of the room. Caroline
is on her feet. She brings her fingers to her eyes and
mouths the words, “Look at me.”
For a second, it helps. I lock my eyes on hers and open
my mouth to speak again, but then the walls feel like
they're warping and bending, and Caroline's face starts to
blur.
Oh, no.
I force myself to bend my knees, like my mom always
tells me to do when I have to give an oral report, so I won't
lock them and faint.
AJ was right. I don't belong here.
“I'm sorry,” I mutter to no one in particular as I roll my
notebook into a tube, wishing I could make the whole thing
disappear. Then I'm off, heading straight for the door.
The door. I run my finger along the seams, over the dead
bolt. I can't get out without the key.
“Hold on.” AJ steps in front of me and starts working the
lock. “It's okay,” he says. He sounds like he genuinely
means it, like he's trying to make me feel better. But I'm not
stupid. I can hear a trace of relief in his voice.
I don't know how to write poetry, let alone read it aloud
to a group of strangers. Besides, I'm not like the rest of
them. I don't need to be here. I have friends. I feel guilty for
thinking it, but it's true. My relationship with the Eights may
be superficial, but at least they don't expect me to spill my
guts to them on a regular basis.
That's when it hits me: this is all a big joke. Payback for
what I did to AJ all those years ago. I bet they'll all have a
good laugh about it when AJ finally gets this fucking door
open.
My whole face feels hot, and tears are welling up in my
eyes as the bolt clicks and the door cracks open. “You
proved your point,” I whisper to AJ, pushing past him. “Don't
worry, I won't be back.” As quickly as I can, I slip back into
the janitor's closet, past the mops, brooms, and chemicals,
and out the door into the hallway.
Caroline will be right on my heels, but I don't want to see
her right now. For a second I think she may have set me up;
then I remember the way she forced me to look at her.
There's no way she would have intentionally hurt me.
I fly up the stairs and into the sun, making a beeline for
the student lot. All I can think about is sliding into the
driver's seat, starting my In the Deep playlist, and shutting
out the world. But when I get to the car and reach for my
backpack, there's nothing there.
My backpack. It's still on the floor back in Poet's Corner
along with everything else that matters. My keys. My phone.
My music. My red and yellow notebooks. My secrets. I slump
against the car door, hugging my blue notebook to my
chest.
The asphalt is getting hotter as the early October
afternoon wears on, and I've had nothing to do out here in
the parking lot but curse the California sun and count the
bells.
One: lunch ended. Two: fifth period began. Three: fifth
ended. Four: sixth began. That's my cue. I brush the parking
lot dust off my butt and head back toward campus, praying I
don't see anybody.
I head through the gate and across the grass until I can
pick up the cement path that leads to my locker. Maybe
Caroline fed a note through one of the vents, telling me
where to find my backpack. As soon as I have it, I'll go
straight to the office, say I'm sick, and ask if I can call my
mom so I can drive home.
The corridors are empty and I reach my locker without
running into anyone. I dial the combination and lift the latch.
No note.
To center myself, I look at the inside of my locker door,
staring at the three pictures Shrink-Sue told me to tape
there, and trying to reconnect with the stronger person I see
in the images. I run my finger across the photo of me on the
diving block, wearing that willful, determined expression.
Confidence. That was the word I said that day.
She wouldn't have run away.
I immediately realize my mistake, and it hits me with
absolute certainty: I have to go back. Even if it was all a
joke, even if they meant to embarrass me, I have to go back
down there and prove I can do it, if not to them, at least to
myself. If I can stand on diving blocks and win a medal, I can
stand on a stage and read a poem.
I belong in that room.
“Hey.” I hear a voice behind me and I turn around. AJ is
sitting at one of the round metal tables on the grass
between the walking paths. There are two backpacks at his
feet. As he stands, he reaches for mine. He crosses the lawn
and hands it to me. “Here, Sam.”
Sam.
“You should have left it in the office or something,” I say,
taking it from him. “You're going to get in trouble for missing
class.”
“And you're not?” he asks, raking his fingers through his
hair.
“I thought I'd go home for the day.” The brief moment of
confidence is gone now that he's standing here. I think
about that stage and that stool, how AJ worked the lock to
let me out of that room, and my face heats.
He's watching me, not saying a word. My gaze settles on
a crack in the cement while I muster up the courage to tell
him the truth.
“I panicked,” I say. “I thought you guys would laugh at
my poem.”
“We wouldn't have.”
“And then I thought maybe it was all a joke. That you
were trying to get me back for what I did to you when we
were kids.” I force myself to meet his eyes.
“I'd never do that.”
I hear Shrink-Sue's voice in my head, talking about
mistakes. Reminding me that they serve a purpose.
“I blew it, didn't I?”
“No. We did.” His expression is different now. It's softer,
almost apologetic. “Look, Sam, we went about that wrong.
There's this whole initiation process we sort of…skipped
over.”
I can't tell if he's joking. I hear the words “initiation
process” and immediately think of blindfolds and candles
and the possibility of water torture.
“Great.” I cover my head with both hands and find that
crack in the cement again.
“Don't worry,” he says. I can hear the laugh in his voice,
and something about it makes me feel more at ease. If he's
laughing, maybe he's smiling too. I've seen him smile, that
one time he was performing on stage, but I've never seen
him smile at me. I look up. Sure enough, he is.
“Instead of skipping sixth and going home, can I
convince you to skip sixth and come with me?”
“Where?”
“Downstairs.”
“Why? Is everyone else there?”
“No. That's kind of the point. You're supposed to get the
room all to yourself. I'll show you what I mean.” He gestures
toward the theater with his chin and takes two steps
backward, moving toward the path.
After that first time, all I wanted to do was hang out in
Poet's Corner for the rest of the afternoon, reading the walls.
I wanted to be alone. I wanted to read every single poem
without interruption.
I want to follow him.
I take a tentative step in AJ's direction.
I want to trust him.
He turns around and starts walking, stopping briefly at
the table to grab his backpack, and we continue across the
grass, straight to the theater. I follow him up to the stage,
down the stairs, past the mops and brooms, and into Poet's
Corner. He keeps the door open to let light in, and points at
the closest lamp. “Hit the light?” he asks.
He bolts the door behind us, and together, the two of us
round the room, turning on lamps as we go. He's faster than
I am, but we still meet each other near the front.
“Sit down.” He sits on the edge of the short, makeshift
stage and I settle in next to him, trying to forget how I made
a complete ass of myself in this very spot less than three
hours ago.
“So here's how this works.” He clears his throat. “The
current members have discussed it, and we would like to
consider you, Samantha—Sam—McAllister, for membership
in Poet's Corner.”
“Why?”
His brow furrows. “Why what?”
“Why do you want me to join? You guys don't even know
me.”
“Well, it's not that simple. You'll need to read first. Then
we vote.”
“So if my poem sucks, I don't get to stay?”
“No. We all write stuff that sucks. We're not judging your
poetry.”
“What are you judging?”
“I don't know. Your…sincerity, I guess.”
He slaps his palms on his legs, stands quickly, and then
holds his hand out to help me up. I take it. I think he's going
to let it drop, but he doesn't. He pulls me over to the center
of the stage, right next to the stool.
“You should see things from this vantage point first, so
you can get used to being up here.” He grabs my arms and
pivots me around so I'm facing the rows of empty chairs and
couches.
“How often?”
“No rules around that.” I hear his voice from behind my
right shoulder. “You can come up here as often or as little as
you like. You have to read once, to put yourself on even
ground with the rest of us, but after that, it's up to you.”
The idea of reading makes me feel sick again, so I reach
for a new topic. “Where did all this furniture come from?” I
can't imagine how they got all this stuff in here. It looks
impossible, especially when you consider that steep, narrow
staircase.
When I turn around again, AJ is perched on the stool with
one leg resting on the rung and the other on the floor. His
arms are crossed over his chest. From this vantage point,
they look kind of muscular. Up until this moment, I thought
he was tall and kind of lanky, in a cute way. He's not lanky.
“Prop room,” he says.
“What do you mean?”
“When you come down the stairs, you turn to the right to
get in here. But if you take a left instead, you wind up in the
prop room.”
I raise an eyebrow. “The prop room?”
“It's the room directly beneath the stage,” he explains.
“There's this huge freight elevator they use to bring the
furniture up and down for performances. Once the play is
done and they no longer need the stage set, those items
live in the prop room until they need them again. Or, until
they're relocated.”
“Relocated?”
He uncrosses his arms and points to the orange couch he
sat in the first time I was here. “That's our newest
acquisition. Cameron and I had to take the legs off to get it
around that tight corner at the bottom of the stairs. It was
wedged in the doorframe for a good ten minutes before we
were finally able to jiggle it through.” He stands up quickly,
takes a bow, and sits down again. “But we pulled it off.”
I grin at him. “You got that couch through that door?”
“Barely.”
As I scan the room, it dawns on me why everything is
mismatched and looks like it came from completely different
time periods. An antique bookcase with a modern lamp. A
retro '70s chair with a sleek metal end table. “Everything in
here came from the prop room?”
“Yep.”
“Don't they miss this stuff?”
“Eh. Pieces have been disappearing little by little over
the last decade, ever since Poet's Corner began. I'm sure
they miss things occasionally, especially the big stuff.”
“Like, for instance, a bright orange couch.”
“Exactly.”
“And even if they did miss it,” I say, suppressing a smile,
“they'd have no idea where to look.”
“Secret room.” His mouth curves up on one side. “I
should probably feel a little bit guilty, shouldn't I?”
“Maybe a little bit,” I say, holding up my hand, thumb
and finger nearly touching.
“It's not like they were stolen.”
“Of course not. They were simply relocated.”
“That couch is really comfortable.” He steps past me and
jumps down onto the ground with a thud. He falls back into
the orange sofa, running his hands back and forth across
the cushions. “And inspirational. You know, if you're looking
for something to write about, this couch would make a great
topic.”
I laugh. “Why would I want to write about a piece of
furniture?” I have a mental illness and four superficial
friends. Surely I have more fodder for a poetic career than
to need an ugly orange couch.
When he grins, that dimple on the left side of his mouth
catches my eye. “I have no idea.” Then he lets his head fall
backward and he stares up at the ceiling. “This is good.
Keep 'em coming.” He motions toward himself with one
hand. “What other questions do you have for me, Sam?”
Sam. Again. That makes two.
I walk around the stage, getting a feel for it under my
feet. I run my fingertips across the stool, remembering how
terrified I was up here. It feels like it's daring me to sit on it
again, so I hop up and take a look around. The room looks
different now that it's emptier. Safer. At least now I feel like
a poet wannabe and not a stripper.
AJ's still reclining into the couch, watching me.
“Tell me more about the rules. You can't criticize
anyone's poetry, especially your own, right?”
“True,” he says. “And the last time I broke that one, you
saw the ramifications firsthand.”
I remember how AJ stood up here with his guitar dangling
from the strap, inviting his friends to throw paper at him.
“Yes, I did.” Thinking back on that day reminds me of
something else I've been wondering about.
“Why do you always start by saying where you wrote
your poem? Why does that matter?”
“Is there a place you like to go when you write? Is there
one particular place that inspires you?”
I picture my room, huddled down in my sheets far past
my bedtime, writing until my hand hurts. It's fine, but I
wouldn't call it inspirational. Then I think about the pool.
“Yeah.”
AJ looks right at me. “We think those places matter. We
think they're worth sharing, you know? Because when you
share them, they become part of the poem.”
Goose bumps travel up my arms. “Hmm. I like that.”
“Yeah, me too. Which reminds me of another.” He hops
back onto the stage and stands right in front of me. “The
first poem you read in Poet's Corner has to be written here.”
“What?”
“Yep.”
Crap. Back in history class, Sydney wasn't telling me I
had to get up on stage. How could I have been so stupid?
“Why did you guys let me start reading today?”
He laughs. “You were going for it. I don't think any of us
knew how to stop you.”
I hide my face. “Until I stopped myself.”
“And I think I speak for all of us when I say we were sorry
you did.”
“Really?”
They wanted me here.
“Of course. You would've been pummeled with paper
when you finished, and I, for one, was especially looking
forward to that part.”
I roll my eyes at him. “Now, that would have been an
interesting initiation.”
“Maybe,” he says, “but this one's better.” He pulls his
phone from his pocket. “We meet on Mondays and
Thursdays at lunch. Sometimes we call additional meetings
for no apparent reason. Is that going to be a problem?”
“No.” Actually, maybe.
“If we invite you to join us, I'll need your number.” He
lifts his phone in the air. I'm not an official member, but he
seems to be asking, so I tell him. He types it in, then slips
his phone back into his pocket. “Any more questions?” he
asks me.
I step off the stage and start walking the perimeter, past
hundreds of slips of paper filled with thousands and
thousands of words. All these people. Each one so exposed
in the most frightening way. I have no idea how I'll ever do
anything close to this.
“I think all of you have a gift I don't possess,” I say
without looking at him.
“What's that?”
I take a few steps forward, watching the walls and the
words as I go. “You seem to know how to articulate your
feelings and share them with other human beings. I'm afraid
my gift is the exact opposite; I'm skilled at holding
everything in.” My chin starts trembling like it does when I
tell Sue something I never intended to admit, but my chest
feels a bit lighter now. I doubt this is what AJ meant when he
asked if I had any questions, but I have to hear his answer
to this one. “How do I learn to do this?”
He gets up from the couch. “I guess you start in a safe
place, with safe people, like in this room, with us.” He's
speaking as he walks toward me. “We trust each other and
we don't judge. You're totally free to blurt here.”
I laugh too loudly. “Me? Yeah, I don't blurt. Ever. My friend
Kaitlyn prides herself on having lots of opinions and always
saying exactly what she thinks. She blurts. Sometimes it
hurts the people around her.”
“That's different,” he says.
I feel myself staring at him. “Do you always say exactly
what you're thinking?”
He shrugs. “I try to. I like to know where I stand with
people, and I figure I owe them the same courtesy. I mean,
I'm never rude or hurtful about it, but I don't see any reason
to be fake. That's a lot of work.”
It is. I would know.
AJ lifts the cord from around his neck and drops it over
my head. His fingers graze my shoulders and the key makes
a little sound as it bounces against a button on my blouse.
“Is this allowed?” I lift it in my hands, running my finger
over the sharp points and grooves.
“Of course. The key belongs to the group. I'm just the
one in charge of the door.”
I'm feeling a little nervous about being down here alone.
What if the power goes out? What if the ventilation fails?
Could anyone get to me? “Does anyone else have a key?”
“Mr. Bartlett. He comes in a few times a month to empty
the trash, vacuum the joint, that type of thing.”
“The janitor? He knows about this place?”
“He's worked here for twenty years. Mr. B knows
everyone and everything. But he keeps our secret to
himself.”
I run my finger along the key again. I don't really want AJ
to go, but at the same time, I'm eager to be alone with all
these poems. I'm dying to finally find his lyrics.
“I'm going to leave, okay?” he says. I expect him to step
away, but he surprises me by stepping toward me. I'm
reminded of how tall he is, and I have to tip my chin up to
see his eyes. I've thought about him so much over the last
month, but now I finally have a chance to really study him.
He's not gorgeous or anything, not like Brandon and the
rest of my recent crushes. But none of them ever made me
feel the way I do right now.
Everything about AJ is pulling me in. The way he's
standing, so confident and in control. The way he's been so
relaxed in this room with me today, making me feel like I do
belong here. The way I remember him playing that one
song, how it practically floated out of his body.
“Stay down here as long as you like. Read the walls;
they're covered with a decade's worth of words written by
more than a hundred people. Meet everyone. Then write
something of your own.”
“Okay,” I whisper. His expression is soft and kind, and his
eyes shine when he talks about the room and me becoming
part of it.
“Lock the door and turn off all the lamps when you're
done. I'll be waiting for you at that table by your locker.”
“Okay,” I say again.
He starts to step away from me, but he stops. “Oh, and if
you want to, practice reading aloud. The stage doesn't feel
quite as scary when the room is empty.”
He squeezes past me and I press my back against the
wall to give him room.
“AJ?” He turns around. I don't want to say it, but I feel like
I need to, because I don't want to be uncomfortable down
here and I certainly don't want him to be. And if they're all
gearing up to judge my sincerity, he should understand how
much it means for him to forgive me.
“You don't have to do this. If you don't want us to be
friends, I get it. It was a long time ago, but the things I said
and did when we were kids…” I trail off, thinking about the
day Kaitlyn and I crank-called his house over and over
again, until his mom finally picked up and screamed in our
ears, begging us to stop. Or that time we sat behind him on
the bus and cleaned out our backpacks, dropping all our
gum wrappers, paper scraps, and pieces of lint down the
back of his shirt. I shake my head and bite my lower lip
hard. “You'll never know how sorry I am.”
He doesn't speak right away. “Why are you telling me
this?” he finally asks.
“I guess…I sort of…” I stammer, searching for the perfect
words. “I wanted to be sure you knew. Just in case you
thought I didn't mean it the first time.”
He gives me another smile. That makes three today. This
one looks even more genuine than the others. “If I didn't
think you meant it the first time, you wouldn't be down
here.”
I have no idea what to say to that, so I just stand with my
thumbs hooked in my front pockets and rock back on my
heels.
“But since we're blurting here,” he says, “I'll be honest. It
wasn't easy for me to let you come down here today. I've
accepted your apology, because I think it's genuine and I'm
not one to hold a grudge, but let's not push the ‘friends'
thing, okay?”
As he walks to the door, he raises his finger in the air and
circles it above his head. “Read the walls, Sam.”
I spend the rest of sixth period and all seventh reading the
walls of Poet's Corner. The poems here are silly,
heartbreaking, hilarious, sad, and many are absolutely
incredible. They're about people who don't care enough and
people who care too much, people you trust and people who
turn on you, hating school, loving your friends, seeing the
beauty in the world. Sprinkled among them are heavier ones
about depression and addiction, self-mutilation and various
forms of self-medication. But most of them are about love.
Wanting it. Missing it. Actually being in it. I read some of
those twice.
None of the poetry is marked with anything that makes
its author identifiable—aside from the fast-food wrappers,
which appear to be Sydney's trademark. Hard as I try, I
can't figure out which ones Caroline penned, but AJ's proved
to be fairly easy; as soon as I found that first song, I had no
trouble finding more of his right-slanted, narrow
handwriting.
By the time the final bell rings, I've read hundreds of
poems. As eager as I am to say I covered every square inch
of this place, I've already been alone down here for over an
hour. AJ's sitting at the table, waiting for me to return, and I
still have a poem of my own to write.
My backpack is still sitting in front by the couch, so I take
a seat and thumb through my notebooks. I skip the red one
because I'm not angry, and the blue one because I'm not
thinking about the pool. The poem that's building inside of
me is a yellow one. My head falls back into the cushions,
and I let my gaze travel around the walls one more time
before I take my pen to the paper. I tap it three times. Then I
let everything go.
I'm perched on the edge of the diving block at the end of
lane number three. I adjust my swim cap, press my goggles
into my eyes with the heels of my hands, and step into my
stance. I scratch the tape three times and dive in.
I spent the whole drive here thinking about my afternoon
in Poet's Corner. Sitting on the stage alone. Reading the
poems. Writing my own. And AJ, who may not be my friend,
but at least he no longer seems to hate me.
But now, everything is so quiet. Not just the pool, but my
mind, too. I don't even feel the urge to swim to the beat of a
song. I'm mentally spent. Out of words. Out of thoughts. It
feels so good to be this empty. It's so peaceful.
Is this what it's like to be normal?
For the next forty minutes, I follow Coach Kevin's
instructions, but I wish I were here alone, without him
yelling at me to swim faster, push myself harder. When
practice is over and the rest of the team heads for the
showers, I hang back in the water and keep swimming a
slow freestyle, back and forth.
Fifteen minutes later, the club is clearing out. The rest of
my teammates are in their sweats and swim parkas,
heading for the front gates, so I pull myself out of the pool
and reach for my towel. As I'm rinsing off, I start thinking
about what's next. If I'm serious about joining Poet's Corner,
I'll have to step on that stage and read next Monday. If they
let me stay, I'll have to read again. And again. I'll have to
come up with an excuse to miss lunch twice a week.
What am I going to tell the Eights?
My heart is racing as I change into my sweats, and my
fingers start tingling as I'm heading for the parking lot. I'm
almost out the gate when I spot Caroline sitting crosslegged
on the grass by my car.
“Hey. What are you doing here?”
She sits up a little straighter and I read her T-shirt:
PROCRASTINATE NOW!
“I hope you don't mind me dropping by. I figured you'd
be here, and I didn't get to see you after, you know…what
happened at lunch today.”
“What happened at lunch today?” I joke. With a dramatic
face palm, I fall back onto the grass next to her.
“I'm sorry,” she says, laughing.
“Did you tell them about my OCD and my anxiety
attacks? Is that why AJ apologized and brought me back
downstairs?”
“No,” she says matter-of-factly. “I never said a word.”
“You swear?”
She draws an X across her heart.
Then I remember what Sydney said in history when she
invited me to go downstairs with her. I meant to thank
Caroline when I first saw her in Poet's Corner, but I never
had the chance to. “You know, they let me back in because
of the poem you helped me write,” I say, coming up on my
elbow.
“You wrote that.”
“Not alone.”
She doesn't say anything, but she knows it's true. If she
hadn't helped me find the right words to apologize to AJ, he
never would have forgiven me.
“Thank you.”
She grins. “Anytime.”
“I have to get back on that stage on Monday.”
“I know. And you'll be fine.” She sounds so certain. I wish
I felt that confident.
“And let's just say for the sake of argument, I pull it off.
Then I'll have to come up with more to read. Which could be
problematic since, as you know, most of my stuff is about
the…” I spin my finger in a circle around my right temple,
but I can't bring myself to say the word “crazy.”
“They can handle it, you know? The…” She mimics my
gesture without saying the word either.
I'm sure they can. But it's taken me five years to tell
anyone outside my family about my disorder, and even
though I let Caroline in on my secret, I'm not ready to share
it with the rest of the members of Poet's Corner. Besides, I
want their vote, not their sympathy. “I just want to keep it
between you and me. At least for now. Okay?”
“You got it.” She presses her lips together and turns an
imaginary key, locking my secrets inside.
“Where have you been?” Kaitlyn asks as I find a spot in
the circle.
“What do you mean?” I start unpacking my lunch bag.
“The bell just rang.”
“Not today. Yesterday.” When I look up, she blows her
straw wrapper at me and it bounces off my forehead. “You
weren't here at lunch, and Olivia said you missed fifth
period.”
“I was just worried,” Olivia says, playing with her food.
“Everything okay?”
“I wasn't feeling well so I went home after fourth.” I take
a sip of my soda. In my peripheral vision, I can see them all
looking at Alexis. “What?” I ask, feeling the familiar
adrenaline rush that always kicks off the panic attack. I steel
myself for whatever it is Alexis is supposed to report
regarding my whereabouts.
She saw me talking with AJ at my locker. Or sneaking into
the theater with Sydney.
“I saw your car in the student lot after school.” She
sounds apologetic, but there's a little accusatory lilt in her
voice. An unsaid Aha. Caught ya.
I don't want to lie to them, but I can't tell them where I
was yesterday. A version of the events I'd been planning
when I ran into AJ yesterday pops into my head, so I go with
it.
“I went to the office and the nurse took my temperature.
Since it was high, she said I wasn't allowed to drive, so my
mom had to come down here and get me.” I add a dramatic
eye roll to punctuate my lie, and give my sandwich my
undivided attention, trying not to appear guilty.
They must not have any other evidence against me
because Alexis says, “Oh. Well, I'm glad you're feeling
better.” When I look up again, she's mixing dressing into her
salad. Hailey gives me a sheepish grin, like she's relieved to
discover that I have a good reason for abandoning them
without a word.
It worked for today, but I'm not sure how I'll skip out of
lunch on Monday. What am I going to do if I'm invited to join
Poet's Corner—fake an illness every Monday and Thursday?
I'm going to need a better cover story.
Olivia starts telling us about this new band on her dad's
label, and how he wants all of us to go to their next show
and bring a bunch of friends to help fill the room. While
everyone's busy checking the concert dates on their
phones, I use the opportunity to disappear into my own
world, thinking up ways to get out of lunch.
It's too early for yearbook. I'm not in any other clubs.
They'll never believe I'm spending two afternoons a week
helping a teacher with some project or preparing for a big
science lab or something. Then it hits me. As usual, I'm
saved by water. It's perfect. I don't typically swim in the
school pool until team practice starts in the spring, but it's
open and heated until early December. There's no reason I
couldn't start earlier.
When there's a lull in the conversation, I jump in. “I've
got a few big meets coming up, so I've decided to start
swimming during lunch a few days a week.” I offer the
information casually as I gesture in the general direction of
the school pool. “I'm getting crushed by homework and it's
getting harder to get to the club. I'm just mentioning it so,
you know, you don't wonder where I am.”
“Hey,” Olivia says excitedly. “I want to come to one of
your meets. I've never seen you race.” She glances around
the circle. “Have you guys?” They all shake their heads.
No. I can't let them watch me swim. When I'm in the
pool, I'm as close to Summer Sam as I get.
“Actually…please don't. I know it sounds weird, but it's
kind of my thing.”
Kaitlyn lets out a huff, affronted. “You compete in front of
huge groups of people all the time. Why would it bother you
if we came to a meet?”
I don't have a good answer at the ready, so I tell them
the truth. “I don't know. Complete strangers watching me
race is one thing. You guys are different. That would make
me totally nervous.” I laugh to deflect the impact of their
glares, but the sound that comes out of my mouth doesn't
sound like a laugh at all.
“We're your best friends,” Alexis says. I can't tell from
her tone of voice if she's offended or simply pointing out a
fact. “Why would you be nervous around us?”
It's an excellent question. One I ask myself all the time.
Before I can answer, Hailey jumps in. “It's okay,” she
says. “We understand.”
“We do?” Kaitlyn asks. Her tone isn't hard to gauge at all.
“It's Samantha's thing.” I look over at Hailey and silently
thank her.
“I still don't get it,” Alexis says. “But whatever. Have fun
swimming at lunch. Alone.”
We go back to eating, and I'm relieved to have that
conversation behind me. I start thinking about next Monday,
mentally pumping myself up to read my poem in front of the
group.
“So, did you guys hear about tomorrow night?” Alexis
asks. “Big party.”
“Where?” Hailey asks.
“Kurt Frasier's.” My head snaps up.
Kaitlyn glares at her. “You have got to be kidding. I am
not going to that asshole's house.”
“And I am?” I add.
Kaitlyn reaches over and grabs my hand in solidarity. I
pull it away.
“Oh, please. You're not still mad about that, are you?”
she asks. “I told you. He kissed me.”
“Kaitlyn, we are not talking about this again.” I say it
firmly, and she must hear the weight in my voice because
she lets out a heavy sigh and drops the subject.
Kurt and I had been together for two months when we
went to winter formal last year. He said he was going to get
a drink, and twenty minutes later, when I went looking for
him, I found him hooking up with Kaitlyn in the coat-check
room.
The two of them didn't last long. A few weeks later, he
and Olivia got together at a party. It started to look like he
intended to work his way through all five of us and was just
getting started. I thought we'd collectively agreed that none
of us would ever speak to him again. How could Alexis even
suggest going to his house?
Alexis looks at Kaitlyn, and then at me. “Look, the guy's a
douche, but he's a douche with a keg and an empty house,
and that's where everyone's going tomorrow night.” She
turns her attention to Hailey and Olivia. “I'm going. You
guys?”
“I'm in,” Olivia chirps. When Kaitlyn shoots her a nasty
look, she adds, “What? He has a nice house. I bet his
parents' liquor cabinet is top shelf.”
Hailey seems to want my approval, because she peeks
over at me. I shrug and look away. “Yeah, sure,” she finally
says.
“Okay, fine. I'll go,” Kaitlyn says. And then she looks at
me. “Samantha?”
“I'm not going.” It feels good to say it so definitively.
Maybe I'll invite Caroline over.
The side entrance to the theater is unlocked. I hurry down
the center aisle, climb the stairs to the stage, and slide in
next to the piano, quietly listening for sounds on the other
side of the curtain. When I hear footsteps, I duck inside.
They've already passed by, but Caroline's at the back of
the group, and when she sees me, the biggest smile spreads
across her face. I smile back as she grabs my arm, pulls me
into the pack, and presses her finger to her lips.
Sydney is directly in front of us, walking next to the girl
with the super curly hair. They both turn around and wave,
but no one says a word as we make our way down the
stairs, through the gray hallway labyrinth, and into the
janitor's closet.
It's so quiet down here. I'm sure everyone can hear me
breathing the way Shrink-Sue taught me to: in through the
nose, out through the mouth. Caroline must be able to tell
I'm nervous because she squeezes my wrist.
AJ holds the door open and we all file in. Everyone
gathers at the back of the room. As soon as they hear the
dead bolt click into place, the silence disappears and the
energy level shifts completely.
The curly blond one says her name is Chelsea. Next to
her, the girl with the dark shoulder-length hair and the tiny
silver nose ring says, “I'm glad you're here. I'm Emily.”
“Hi,” I say. “Thanks.” My palms are sweaty and my
heart's pounding, but it feels similar to that moment before I
dive off the blocks, so I'm pretty sure it's positive adrenaline
and not the first sign of a panic attack.
“I'm Jessica.” The thin girl with the long black braids
raises her hand and whispers, “Welcome.”
There's only one other guy. He's short, stocky, and
wearing a North Valley High Wrestling tee, so I assume
that's Cameron, AJ's partner in large-furniture-relocation
crime. He adjusts his glasses and waves at me.
I greet Abigail by name and tell her it's nice to see her
again, and she surprises me by pulling me into a tight hug.
When she lets me go, Sydney throws one arm over my
shoulder and shows everyone our matching letter S
pendants.
Caroline stands there, beaming as if this whole moment
is going exactly the way she pictured it, and AJ gives me
that casual chin tilt of his and says, “You don't have to read
right away today. Listen first, okay?”
“What makes you think I'd just jump up on stage and
start reading?” I ask sarcastically, and they laugh.
AJ smiles at me. Then he addresses the group. “We'd
better get started.” He takes off for the front of the room
and plops down on that orange couch he loves so much.
Everyone trails behind him and settles into various spots
on the mismatched furniture, but I hang back, giving myself
a moment to reacquaint myself with the room.
The walls look a little bit different now. The colors are
brighter, the textures richer. Even the penmanship feels
personal, almost intimate, like all these words on all these
scraps of paper are here especially for me. I've read these
poems now. I know these authors. We all share a secret, and
it makes me feel small, in a good way, like I'm part of
something bigger—something powerful and magical and so
special it can't be explained. I breathe it all in, appreciating
everything about these walls, especially their chaos.
AJ's standing on the stage now with his arms crossed,
and I realize he's watching me, waiting for me to take a
seat.
Sydney calls me over, so I sit next to her. I start feeling
edgy, but I remind myself that I don't have to read right
away. I should listen first. Listen and clap. That's it.
Listen. Clap. And breathe.
I turn around and find Caroline on the couch behind me.
She gives me a thumbs-up.
Chelsea takes her seat on the stool. Some of the others
are wearing dramatic eye shadow, and a few have visible
tattoos and piercings, but not Chelsea. Like Caroline, she's
not wearing any makeup at all, and for a moment, I picture
what I could do with a little bit of blush and some lip gloss.
Maybe some product to shape her curls into well-defined
ringlets, and a headband to pull them away from her face.
Then I catch myself.
“I wrote this in my car last week.” Everyone's quiet while
Chelsea unfolds a slip of paper. “This is called ‘Over You.'”

We're all silent for a minute. No one moves. No one
claps.
Only a minute ago I was sitting here, planning Chelsea's
makeover, and now I'm staring at her, filled with a strange
mix of sadness and jealousy. She had all that? I'm sad for
her, but I can't help but feel a little bit sad for myself, too. I
want that. She lost it, but at least she had it.
“Hello? Glue stick?” The room erupts into applause, and
Sydney stands and tosses her the glue. I'm clapping along,
but I'm also watching Chelsea, wondering if she's going to
cry after that cathartic reading. She doesn't. She throws her
shoulders back as she steps proudly off the stage.
“Okay!” I hear the voice at the front of the room and find
Abigail bouncing in place, shaking out her arms by her
sides. “I still get a little nervous up here,” she says, and it
surprises me. Abigail doesn't seem like the type to get
nervous. Then I remember she told me she was the newest
one in the group. She runs her hands over her dark pixie cut
and looks down at the paper in her hands. “I wrote this in
science class last week.”
She holds up a ripped scrap of graph paper, sits on the
stool, and takes a couple of deep breaths, like she's
readying herself.
“This is called ‘As If,'” she says, and she shakes out her
arms again. When she starts to read, I can see the paper
trembling in her hands.

hen I'm on a stage.
I'm the first to start clapping. I can't help it. That was
totally unexpected.
Sydney hands me a glue stick. “Want to do the honors?”
she asks. I take it from her, beaming as I toss it underhand
to Abigail.
I glance around, wondering who's next. There doesn't
seem to be any assigned order or anything, and I'm waiting
for the next person, ready to watch them be brave. Abigail
sticks her poem to the back wall, and then returns to the
stage as Cameron and Jessica jump up from their seats to
join her.
Jessica walks to the edge. She's wearing a tank top, and
when she turns, I spot a small tattoo on the back of her right
shoulder. When she greeted me at the door, she was so softspoken
that I assumed she was really shy, but now she's full
of energy, and when she opens her mouth to speak, a loud,
authoritative voice emerges.
“Okay. I know we've been building this up,” she says with
her hands on her hips. “You finally get to hear what we've
been working on, but we need you to help us out.”
She slaps her hands against her legs, starting the beat—
Left-left-left-right, left-left-left-right, left-left-left-right—and
she keeps it going while the rest of us join in. Left-left-leftright,
left-left-left-right.
Then Jessica looks right at me, the beat still thumping in
the background, and says, “We've been working on this for
the last month or so, but it's still far from perfect. This is the
first time we're performing it down here. So, no judgment.”
I'm not sure why she cares what I think, but I'm kind of
flattered. Maybe they're as nervous about performing in
front of me as I am about performing in front of them.
“This is Edgar Allan Poe's ‘The Raven,'” she says, and
then steps back in line with the other two. And right on the
beat, Cameron takes a step forward and begins speaking in
a booming voice.
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and
weary…
And he keeps going, reciting the poem from memory. On
key lines, the other two join in. He finishes with a bold Only
this and nothing more, and Jessica instantly picks up where
he left off.
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December…
Her words are loud and clear and right on the beat, and I
feel chills all over when she delivers the last line: Nameless
here for evermore.
That's when Abigail jumps in.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me…
She's head-bobbing to the rhythm, singing the verses
more than saying them, and the rest of us are still slapping
our legs and tapping our feet in unison, keeping the beat,
interjecting an encouraging yell now and then.
The three of them say the last line together:
This it is and nothing more.
They stop completely. It takes the rest of us a beat or two
to realize it, and we taper off a little more slowly, but then
we all stand up, bursting into applause. The three of them
hold hands and bow. Abigail curtsies a few more times on
her own.
“There's a lot more to that poem,” Jessica says when the
room is silent again. “Fifteen more stanzas to be exact, but
we'll keep working on it.”
Abigail pulls a piece of paper off the stool and AJ tosses
her the glue stick. She slides it across the paper and the
first three stanzas of “The Raven” occupy a previously
empty sliver of space on the wall.
“We have time for one more,” AJ says from his spot up
front, and while he doesn't call me out specifically, I know
I'm up.
I don't think I can do this.
Something brushes against my shoulder and I turn
around. Caroline's leaning against the back of my couch.
“Go,” she says, tilting her head toward the stage.
I shake my head at her and mouth, I can't, but she raises
her eyebrows and whispers, “Sam. Don't think. Just go.”
Before I realize what I'm doing, I hear myself say, “I'll
go.” It's not loud, but it's loud enough for Sydney to hear,
and that's all it takes.
“Sam!” she yells, and suddenly everyone's looking at us.
My stomach turns over as I reach down into my pack for my
yellow notebook. I take my time finding it.
When I stand, all eyes are on me, and my first instinct is
to sit back down, but I force myself to step into the aisle
instead. The room is so silent, I can hear my sandals
slapping against my heels. I step onto the stage and turn
around, giving myself a moment to take in the room. I feel
my shoulders relax.
I can do this.
“I wrote this here in Poet's Corner,” I say, perching
myself on the stool. Everyone claps and cheers. The
notebook quivers in my hands.
“I have this thing for the number three. I know it's
weird.” I'm expecting a few confused looks, but their
expressions don't change at all.
Okay. The hardest part is over. They know about the
threes. Read.
“This poem is called…” I stop. I look at them, one at a
time, saying their names in my head to remind myself that
they're no longer strangers.
Sydney, Caroline, AJ, Abigail, Cameron, Jessica.
The next girl takes me a second.
Emily.
But then I look at the girl with the blond curly hair and
my mind goes blank. She read first today. Her poem was
incredible. Her name starts with a C. When she raises her
hand and waves, I realize I'm staring at her, and I feel the
adrenaline surge kick in as heat radiates from my chest to
the tips of my ears.
Shit.
Now, my breathing feels shallow and uneven again, and I
rest my hand on my stomach. I think I'm going to be sick. I
fix my gaze on the poem I wrote down here last week, and
the words blur and spin. I blink fast and try to focus again.
But I can't.
I can't do this.
I'm about to make an excuse and step down, when I feel
a hand on my left shoulder. I turn my head and see Caroline
standing there. I want to say something, but the inside of
my mouth feels like I've been chewing on a piece of chalk.
“Close your eyes,” she whispers. “Don't look at anyone.
Don't even look at the paper. Close your eyes and speak.” I
start to object, but she cuts me off before I can say
anything. “You don't need to read it. You know this poem
cold. Just close your eyes. Don't think. Go.”
I close my eyes. Take a deep breath. And begin.
“It's titled ‘Building Better Walls,'” I say.
ll these words
On these walls.
eautiful, inspired, funny,
Because they're yours.
ords terrify me.
To hear, speak,
o think about.
Wish they didn't.
stay quiet.
Keeping words in
here they fester
and control me.
'm here now.
Letting them out.
reeing my words
Building better walls.
I didn't feel Caroline's hand leave my shoulder, but when
I open my eyes I spot her in the back of the room again.
She's clapping and screaming along with everyone else, and
although I'm still shaky, it feels different now, more like
euphoria than fear.
Chelsea. Her name comes to me the second I see her
smiling.
And suddenly there are glue sticks flying at me from all
directions, and I'm laughing as I deflect them. Finally, I catch
one in midair.
AJ steps onto the stage and comes in close.
“Congratulations,” he says.
I lean in even closer. “I thought you needed to vote?” I
whisper.
He nudges me with his elbow. “We just did,” he says,
gesturing toward the glue sticks scattered all over the
stage. Then AJ points to the one in my hand. “Go ahead.
Make it official.”
I run the glue across the back of my poem, and then I
step off the stage and walk toward the back of the room,
past all of them. I stop right next to Caroline, find an empty
spot on the wall, and slap my words against it.
Three weeks later, I'm beaming as I open my locker after
lunch.
Today, I read a simple, six-word poem I wrote on a hot
pink, happy-looking Post-it. On one side, it said: What you
see…And on the other side: It isn't me.
I wondered if the Poets might consider a six-word poem
to be a cop-out, but I forced myself not to question it, and
when I read, I stood tall and didn't even break a sweat.
When I finished, they were up on their feet, cheering loudly
like they always do. As I mounted my poem to the wall, I
bent the paper so it stuck straight out, making both sides
visible.
Four times on stage. Four poems on the wall. I don't quite
feel like one of them yet, but at least I'm contributing.
I grab the block of pink Post-its out of my backpack and
carefully write out the same poem, and then I stand back
and stare at my locker door, looking for the perfect home for
it. I move a few things around until those three photos
Shrink-Sue asked me to print slightly overlap the ones of the
Eights and me. The noise ordinance looks out of place, so I
crumple it into a ball and stuff it into my backpack. I move
the picture of me standing on the blocks right next to the
small mirror, and let the words “What you see…” bridge the
gap between the two.
I'm leaving campus that afternoon as the Indian summer
sun beats down. It's late October, but it's got to be almost
ninety degrees out here. After I open my car door, I let my
head fall back, face toward the sky, and close my eyes,
feeling the rays heat my cheeks. It feels calming. But the
water will feel even better. I can't wait to get to the pool.
Throwing my backpack on the passenger seat, I turn the
key in the ignition, but before I back out, I thumb through
my playlists, trying to find something that matches my
mood. I settle on Make it Bounce.
The student lot is almost empty, so it doesn't take long to
get out through the gates and onto the street. I'm humming
along while I wait for the light to change, and when it does, I
take a left onto the main road that leads through town and
toward the swim club. I've only made it a block when I hit
another red light. I turn the volume up another notch. As I'm
waiting, I look out the passenger window. My breath catches
in my throat.
AJ is sitting at the bus stop with his arm around a girl,
and I squint to get a better look. Her head is down, so I can't
see her face, but I recognize her by her build and the way
her dark hair flips up at her shoulders. It has to be Emily.
Out of all of them, I know her the least. She always sits in
the back with Chelsea, and I've never heard her read on
stage, but I often think about her warm greeting the day I
joined.
She slides her fingertips under her eyes and I realize
she's crying. I glance over at AJ. He's staring right at me.
I turn away quickly, but when I look back again, he's
signaling me to pull over. As I approach, I cut the music and
roll the window down. AJ leans in.
“Hey, can I ask a favor? Em needs a ride.” He looks back
over at her and I follow his gaze in my rearview mirror. “Her
mom is really sick, and her dad sent this text telling her to
come straight home, which…can't be good.”
I look at the odometer.
I'm not supposed to have passengers.
I glance into the rearview mirror again and see Emily
typing away on her phone and brushing away tears at the
same time. “Sure. Of course.”
When AJ returns with Emily, he climbs in back.
Wait. He's coming too?
“Hi. Are you okay?” I ask, and she gives me a weak,
“Yeah. Thanks.”
From the backseat, AJ feeds his arm over her shoulder
and she wraps her fingers through his. I look at their hands,
intertwined.
Of course he has a girlfriend. How could I have missed
that?
I feel a pang of sadness, but I push the thought away,
forcing myself to think of Emily and whatever's going on in
her life so I don't fixate on anything else. It works.
AJ navigates. Left here, right here, straight for about a
mile, and stop, it's this house, the white one on the left. I
look at the odometer, resting on zero.
I overshoot the driveway on purpose. I pass two more
houses, turn around in a court, and double-back. Three.
Perfect.
Emily's house is small but cute, cottagey-looking,
complete with a white picket fence, a big oak tree smack in
the middle of the lawn, and a tire swing hanging from the
thickest branch. It's painted white with bright blue trim and
bright blue shutters, and it looks so cheery, it strikes me as
odd that anyone could be sick or sad on the other side of
that bright blue door.
“Thanks, Sam,” Emily mumbles as she climbs out of the
car. AJ steps out onto her driveway, and when he hugs her,
she buries her face in his chest. He says something I can't
hear, and she comes up on her tiptoes to kiss him on the
cheek.
He climbs into the front seat next to me, and together,
we watch Emily open the door and step inside. “Thanks,” he
says. “That was really cool of you.”
“Of course.”
Wait. He's not staying with Emily? I have to do the
odometer thing all over again?
“Is she okay?” I ask as I back out of the driveway.
“I don't know.” He's quiet for a long time, staring out the
window. “Her mom has stage four lung cancer,” he finally
adds.
Now I really don't know what to say. I'm curious to know
more about Emily's mom, but I don't want to ask, and AJ
doesn't seem to be planning on sharing any more
information, so we're both silent for the next few blocks as I
snake through the residential neighborhood, back the way I
came, heading toward the main road. He tells me to take a
right—I assume to get to his house—and then goes back to
staring out the window.
I'm sad he has a girlfriend, but watching him right now
reinforces what I already suspected about him: he's a good
guy.
“How long have you been together?” I ask.
“We're not together.” He doesn't look at me. “We're just
friends. We've been good friends for a long time.”
They're friends.
It reminds me of what he said in Poet's Corner that day,
warning me not to push the friends thing with him.
Out of nowhere, he shakes his head hard and sits straight
up. “Sorry. I'm worried about her. I'll snap out of it.” He
twists in his seat to face me. “Subject change. I liked the
poem you read this afternoon.”
“Thanks.” I picture the Post-it in its new home on my
locker door, and smile to myself. “Sometimes there's a
whole side of your personality you don't always show
everyone, you know?” I glance down at the odometer. It's
on seven. “I've been thinking about that a lot lately.”
He leans back in his seat and I steal a glance at him. He's
watching me with an inquisitive look in his eye. “It's
interesting. Usually, after people read a few times, they
start to make more sense to me, but every time you read, I
find myself…” He pauses, searching for the right words.
“More curious about you.”
“Good. Then we're even,” I say.
“Are we?” he asks.
“I've been curious about you for a while now.” I'm not
sure where this boldness is coming from, but it feels pretty
natural. I look over at him. “Sorry. That was all your fault.”
“Mine?” He laughs. “How so?”
“Blurting.” I take a left at the light and merge into traffic,
picking up a little speed. “I've been practicing.”
“And how's that going for you?”
“Not so great. I probably took it too far today.”
He raises his eyebrows. “How so?”
“Kaitlyn isn't speaking to me because she told me my
hair looked ridiculous like this.” I point at the braided, twisty
thing I did this morning. I wanted to try something new.
“And instead of heading off to the bathroom to change it like
I normally would, I told her that her blush was too heavy and
she looked like a mime.”
“Well, if she looked like a mime, it makes perfect sense
that she's not speaking to you,” he says.
That cracks me up.
“I shouldn't have said that to her,” I say, grimacing. “It
was probably more bitchy than blurty, wasn't it?”
“Maybe. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.” He grabs
my phone from the cup holder. “Want me to put on some
music to kill this awkward silence?” he asks with a grin.
Normally I'd be irritated by the idea of someone poking
around in my music—it seems personal, like rifling through
my underwear drawer—so I'm surprised when I hear myself
say, “Sure” and then tell him my password, like I do that all
the time. Out of the corner of my eye I can see him sliding
his finger across the screen. I don't even feel the urge to
grab the phone out of his hand.
“Hmm,” he says.
“What?”
“Oblivious to Yourself. A Cryptic Word. It's a Reinvention.
Are these playlist titles, or a creative way to study for the
SATs?”
I've never let anyone see my playlists, and I've never
told anyone how I name them, but he's looking at me like
he's genuinely curious.
“You'll think it's weird.”
“Try me.”
I can tell from the expression on his face that he's not
going to let me off the hook.
“Fine. When I was in fifth grade, my mom and I went to
see this linguist speak at the public library. I fought with her
about going, but once I got there, I was completely
fascinated.
“He talked about words—where they come from, how
new ones evolve, how politicians and advertising executives
and even journalists use them to subtly manipulate people's
opinions. I've had this thing for words ever since. Especially
lyrics. I don't just listen to songs, I study them. It's kind of a
hobby.”
Shrink-Sue doesn't call it a hobby. She calls it an
obsession. A ritual. Whatever.
AJ looks like he approves. He still seems interested. So I
keep talking.
“I've mentioned that I have this thing for the number
three, right? Well, when I'm done making a new playlist, I
pick one song that, sort of, captures the mood, you know?
And then I find three words I like within those lyrics, and that
becomes the title.
“Like the playlist Melt with You. It's a bunch of upbeat
eighties dance tunes, and kicks off with the song Melt with
You. And I love the word ‘melt'…it's so visual, right? And the
songs are kind of cheesy, so it fits. Melllllt.” I say the word
slowly, drawing it out, and I feel my mouth turn up into a
satisfied smile. “See. It makes me happy every time I say
it.”
I look over my right shoulder, wondering if he's
considering asking me to pull over and let him out of the
crazy girl's car. Instead I find him sliding his thumb up and
down the screen again. “Okay, I've got to know about Grab
the Yoke.” He glances at me. “Yoke. Great word. Limited
uses.”
Hmm. I'm not sure how to explain this playlist without
admitting more than I'm ready to. I go for it anyway. “Track
four, ‘Young Pilgrims' by the Shins.”
“Excellent song.” I catch his head bouncing lightly, in
time with the beat, and I can tell he's thinking through the
lyrics, hunting for the word “yoke.”
I spare him the effort and feed him the line. “I know I've
got this side of me that wants to grab the yoke from the
pilot and just fly the whole mess into the sea.” I pull up to a
red light. “I love that line. I don't often want to grab the
yoke and crash into the sea, but sometimes I do.”
Great. Now he's staring at me like he's worried about my
safety or something. “That one's kind of a depressing
playlist. I listen to it when I need a good cry. But don't worry,
I'm not about to off myself or anything.”
“What's Song for You?” he asks, and I feel the blush heat
my cheeks when I think about the playlist filled with
acoustic guitar songs I selected because I could see him on
stage, playing them, singing them. At night, I sometimes
pop in my earbuds, close my eyes, and imagine him playing
them and singing them to me.
“Nothing. Just a playlist,” I say, hoping he won't open it
up to check its contents.
He doesn't respond right away. There still isn't any music
on, and now he's telling me to turn onto his street.
“So your fascination with words isn't a new thing?”
“No. Just the poetry part.”
I can tell we're getting close to his house, but I'm not
ready for him to get out of my car. I try to think of a
question that will keep him talking even after we reach his
driveway.
“When did you start playing guitar?” I ask.
“Seventh grade,” he says.
Keep him talking. Keep him talking.
“What made you choose guitar?”
“You.” He's still running his fingertip along my phone,
and he doesn't take his eyes off the screen after he says it.
“Me? What do you mean ‘me'?”
“Do you really want to know?”
I look at him out of the corner of my eye. “I think so.”
“It's this one here,” he says, pointing up at a long, steep
driveway. I check the odometer. It's almost on three. I turn
left, step on the gas, and stop in front of his garage door.
When I pull the parking brake, the odometer hasn't moved
much, but it's close enough.
Three. Yes!
I cut the engine and twist in my seat so I can see him
better. “So, what do I have to do with you playing guitar?” I
ask. I was bursting with curiosity, but now that I study his
face, I'm not sure I should be.
“Well, not you, per se. But a bunch of people like you
were when we were kids.”
Uh-oh. My stomach drops.
He tosses my phone into the cup holder. “I transferred to
a new school in fifth grade, but as you can probably
imagine, I was a big target there, too.” He laughs a little,
even though it's not funny at all. “My mom finally took me
to see a speech therapist. I went every week, but I didn't
make much progress. Eventually, it seemed easier to just
stop talking.”
I suck in a breath and press my lips together.
“But then, in seventh grade, I had this incredible music
teacher. She handed me a guitar. She worked with me after
school, every day, all year long, teaching me how to play. It
gave me something I didn't have before, you know? It kind
of…gave me a voice, I guess.”
“Yeah,” I say, hanging on every word he says.
“Then, one day, I started singing. And when I did, the
stutter disappeared completely.”
“Really?”
“It was like I needed to trick my brain, to distract it with
something else. After that, my speech therapist starting
working music into our sessions, and ever since then, it's
gotten better. Now it only hits me when I get really nervous.
Like, when I'm sitting in my driveway in a girl's car.” He
peeks up at me from behind his thick lashes. “Then I trick
my brain by doing this.”
He looks down at his hands and I follow his gaze. He's
got his finger and thumb pressed together, brushing them
against the seam on his jeans. “No one realizes it, but when
I have to talk in class, I'm always playing invisible guitar
strings under my desk.”
“AJ…” I begin, but I don't know how to finish. I have no
idea what to say.
He reaches behind him, feeling for his backpack. “Do you
want to come in?”
I look up at the house for the first time. It's a small
single-story nestled into the trees, like one of the original
cabins built in our Northern California town back in the
1940s. There are lots of houses like this around here, but
most have been added on to, remodeled, or knocked down
completely. This one doesn't appear to have had any work
done to it.
“Do you want me to?”
“Yeah.” He opens the car door and looks at me, smiling.
God, I really like it when he does that.
“I don't know.” I smile back at him. “That might make it
seem like we're becoming friends.”
“Hmm,” he murmurs. “Maybe we are.”
Inside, AJ's house is pretty and well decorated, but just as
dated as the outside. The carpet is dark brown shag, and I
don't even want to venture to guess how long the wallpaper
has been there, but the furniture is nice, and even though
it's a mishmash of styles, it all kind of works together. It's
cute.
AJ sets his keys on the table in the entryway and drops
his backpack on the floor.
“Is your mom home?” I ask.
“She's at work. She gets home around six.” He gestures
toward what I assume is the kitchen and says, “Do you want
anything to eat? Something to drink?”
I shake my head and set my keys on the table next to
his. “Is anyone else home?”
He looks down the hallway. “My brother, Kyle, might be
here, but I doubt it. He plays soccer so he's never around.”
Of course. Why hadn't I put the two together before?
“Kyle's your brother?”
Kyle Olsen was the first freshman in years to make it onto
the varsity soccer team. He's really good. He's also
incredibly good looking. Because of his age, Olivia was
worried about what the rest of us would think after she
hooked up with him at a party last year, but over dinner the
next night, we collectively listed his attributes on a napkin
and unanimously approved him as the only freshman
acceptable to date. Armed with the Crazy Eights' stamp of
approval, Olivia jumped in with both feet. But she was
mortified when, in the days that followed, Kyle didn't go out
of his way to see her again and gave single-word replies to
her many, many texts.
AJ steps into the living room and I follow him. The walls
are covered with framed photos of both of them, but Kyle's
definitely stand out, his action shots on the field dominating
AJ's formal school pictures. I note the photos of his mom
with the two of them, and I wonder what happened to his
dad, but I don't ask. I'm going with divorce. Kaitlyn's dad
died when we were in third grade, and there are still
pictures of him all over their house.
“In case you're wondering, yes, I'm well aware of the fact
that my little brother's a lot cooler and much better looking
than I am.” He points at a close-up of his brother in a casein-
point sort of way and then grins at me. There's that
dimple again. I look at a photo of Kyle. He doesn't have one
of those. “I'll probably need therapy someday.”
I try not to take his therapy comment personally. “Hey,
don't knock it. You might enjoy paying someone to listen to
you talk about your problems.”
“I wasn't knocking it at all.”
I roll my eyes. “Besides, I doubt you'd need it. You seem
pretty well adjusted.”
He steps closer and leans in, like he's telling me a secret,
and the sudden gesture of familiarity takes me aback. He
seems even taller now that he's this close. He looks cute in
his button-down shirt. And he smells good, like boy
deodorant. “Everyone's got something,” he says.
“Do they?”
“Of course they do. Some people are just better actors
than others.” His words remind me of Abigail's poem about
acting “as if.”
He's still close, nearly touching me, and I feel an
overwhelming impulse to tell him my “something.” If I stood
here in his living room and told him about Shrink-Sue and
my OCD and my sleep issues and my severe lack of
adjustment—how, over the years, I've become an Oscarworthy
actress, so skilled you'd think I'd tricked myself into
actually being one of the normal ones—would he
understand? I bet he would.
My mouth drops open and the single syllable “I” falls
right out, as if my body's ready to spill everything, even
though my brain is telling me in no uncertain terms to zip it.
He's watching me, waiting for me to say more. “Can I get a
glass of water?” I ask.
Chicken.
He raises his eyebrows. If he asks, I'll tell him everything.
The words are right there. They just need a little nudge, the
tiniest bit of permission. But AJ says, “Sure,” and steps
backward, breaking our invisible connection.
I watch him leave the room, and as soon as he's out of
sight, I blow out a breath, shut my eyes tight, and dig my
fingernails into the back of my neck three times. He just told
me all about his stuttering, and that couldn't have been
easy for him. I should tell him about me. He'd understand.
I'm sure he would.
The water is running in the other room, and when I hear
it stop, I use that as my cue to pull myself together. I open
my eyes and quiet my fingers before he returns.
“Here you go.” He hands me the glass.
“Thanks.” His lips are full and they look like they'd be
really soft. I wonder what it would be like to kiss him.
“Follow me,” he says, and so I do, down the hallway, past
two other bedrooms, and into his. He closes the door behind
us.
I've seen plenty of boys' bedrooms, mostly at parties, but
stepping into AJ's room feels different, like I'm doing
something scandalous. Kurt was the most serious boyfriend
I've ever had, but his mom had a strict rule that girls
weren't allowed beyond the kitchen. One time, we snuck
into his room anyway. I don't remember feeling like this.
I recognize some of the bands in the posters on his walls,
like Arctic Monkeys and Coldplay, and I'm pretty sure the
guy with the guitar is Jimmy Page. His desk is cluttered with
mountains of loose papers, notebooks, gum wrappers, and
empty soda cans. I can barely see the computer monitor
and its matching keyboard.
His bed is just a mattress and box spring sitting directly
on the floor and pushed into a corner under the window. It's
neatly made with a navy blue comforter and white pillows,
and I try not to stare at it.
“So this is where you write?” Every time he steps on
stage to play a song, he begins by saying, “I wrote this in
my room,” and it always makes me wonder what it looks
like. In my head, I have this picture of him sitting at a desk
with his guitar on his lap and his notebook in front of him.
But there's no room on that desk for even the smallest pad
of paper.
He holds his arms out to his sides and says, “Not much to
see, but yeah. This is it.” He struts over to the corner of the
room and lifts his guitar off the stand, and it sort of floats
along with him, as if it's part of his body. He sits on the edge
of the bed and starts playing. I'm not familiar with the song,
but it's soft and melodic, like a tune I'd put on my In the
Deep playlist.
I'm not sure where to go. I'm dying to sit next to him, but
that feels too awkward, so I finally settle on leaning against
his desk. On top of a stack of papers, I spot a tortoiseshell
guitar pick. I start fiddling with it to distract myself.
Actually, I like this spot. From here, I have a perfect view
of his hands. I stare at his fingers, mesmerized by the way
they slide up and down each string, and I begin to picture
them sliding up and down my body instead, tracing the
curve of my hip and slipping over the small of my back. I
watch his mouth move, too, enjoying the way he
unconsciously smiles and licks his lips as he plays. He
glances over at me. I suck in a breath. And before I know it,
I'm taking slow, cautious steps, moving in his direction.
When I'm standing right in front of him, I wrap my hands
around the back of his neck. “Don't stop playing,” I say as I
rest my elbows on the edge of his guitar and bring my
mouth to his. His fingers continue to glide along the strings,
his notes still filling the room as his tongue slips slowly over
mine in perfect synchronization with his song. My fingers
move through his hair. I ease him closer. Then the music
stops.
“This is all the stuff I'm working on,” he says.
His words jolt me back to the room and I realize he's
holding up a clipboard bursting with paper, and I'm still
standing next to his desk, at least six feet away from him. I
cover my mouth and catch my breath, as AJ drags his thumb
through the pages. “There's a lot of crap in here, but the
ones on top might actually have potential.”
It sounds like an invitation to join him, so I slip his guitar
pick into the front pocket of my jeans, and with shaky legs, I
walk toward his bed and sit. I'm still trying to breathe
normally and block out that kiss that didn't actually happen,
but it's even harder now that he's this close. And when his
lips still look so insanely soft.
“May I?” I ask, pointing toward the clipboard. He gives
me a single nod as he hands it to me. I can't imagine
offering up my three notebooks and letting someone have
their way with them, but he doesn't seem to mind. He goes
back to playing.
AJ plucks and strums next to me while I read page after
page. Some of his songs are funny—humorous observations
on mundane things like microwave burritos and car washes
—and some are much deeper, far more intense, and not
funny at all. I go from laughing to chills and goose bumps
and back to laughing again.
“Stop it,” AJ says. He looks amused as he watches his
fingers pick at the strings. He's still filling the room with
notes.
“Stop what?”
“You're being too nice to me. They're not that good.”
“They are,” I say, flipping to another one.
AJ stops playing. He holds his hand out. I give him the
clipboard and he drops it on top of the comforter, slightly
out of my reach.
I expect him to start playing again, but instead he shifts
position and lifts his guitar over his head. “Here,” he says as
he loops the strap around my neck.
I try to push the guitar away. “No way. I don't have a clue
how to play this thing. I liked listening to you.” I reach
behind us, feeling for the clipboard. “Play something you're
working on,” I say, but he stands up and grabs my arms,
and I freeze in place. I hold my breath. I look at him. I don't
move because if I do, he might move his hands.
“Right now I'm working on teaching you to play guitar,”
he says.
He adjusts it in place and shows me where to put my
fingers, saying things like, That string. Good. Now index
finger on that one. Not so flat. Bend your fingers more. Use
the tips, not the pads. Better.
“That feels weird.”
“Then you're doing it right.”
It feels like my hands can't stretch far enough.
“Now strum.”
A sound comes out. It actually resembles a chord.
“Good, now move this finger here.” He lifts my finger off
one string and moves it to another. “Now strum again.”
Again, that sounds like a chord. It even sounds like those
two chords work well together.
“That's good,” he says. “Now play both of them.” I move
my finger back to the first string, play the chord, move it
again, and play the next one. And then he shows me how to
play another, and I put the three together, over and over
again. AJ returns to his spot on the bed, watching me.
“See?” he says. “Told you. Piece of cake.”
“I'm not bad.” I play my three little chords again, this
time with a little more shoulder and a bit of attitude.
“Okay, this next one is trickier.” He climbs onto the bed,
and now he's on his knees, right behind me. I feel his thighs
brush against my hips. “Scoot back a bit,” he says, and I do.
Oh, please let this be real.
He moves in even closer, resting his chest against my
back and reaching around me, looking over my shoulder,
repositioning my hands.
“There, that's easier.” He says it like he's a teacher and
I'm his student and this is totally normal, just part of the job.
His voice is low, but he's so close to my ear, I can hear him
breathing. “Pinkie here. Okay, try that,” he whispers. I
strum, and when I do, it sounds like a real note.
“Now play the other three and add this one.”
I'm not sure I can do this when I can feel his chest rise
and fall against my back, but I go for it. The last note feels
awkward, and it takes me a few tries to get it right, but
eventually I get all four chords to work together, and it
sounds a lot like music. “That's really good,” he says. “How
does it feel?”
His breath is warm on my neck. “It feels incredible.”
“Want to play it one more time?” he whispers in my ear.
My fingers are glued to the strings and I can't move them. I
shake my head, because I don't want to play it one more
time. I want to bring my hand to his cheek because it's right
there, and I want to turn my head a little more to the left
and kiss his lips because they're right there too. He's quiet. I
wonder if he's thinking the same thing I am.
He's not. Teaching moment complete, he scoots out from
behind me and sits by my side again, this time leaving
slightly more space between us. I miss him instantly.
“Thanks.” I give him his guitar, and he takes it without
putting up a fight this time.
“That wasn't so horrible, was it, Sam?” he asks, as he
feeds his head through the strap.
Sam. I'm still not used to hearing him say my name.
“No. It wasn't.” I'm all buzzy. To clear my head, I stand
and walk around the room, shaking out my hands, giving all
my attention to the posters on the wall. On his desk, behind
a big stack of papers, I see the top half of a silver picture
frame. I pick it up.
It's AJ and a girl I've never seen before. She's sitting
between his legs, leaning back against his chest. Both of his
arms are wrapped tightly around her waist and his chin is on
her shoulder. She's pretty. Not in a glamorous way or
anything, but in that natural, sporty kind of way.
I hold up the frame and ask, “Who's this?”
AJ gives a quick glance in my direction, fingers still on the
strings, but when he sees what I'm holding, he stops
playing. “Um…that's Devon.”
He sets his guitar on the bed and stands, combing his
fingers through his hair as he approaches me. “We broke up
last summer. I didn't even remember that was still on my
desk.” He waves his hand toward the stack of papers it was
hiding behind as proof.
I stare at the photo again. “Do I know her?”
“No. We met at one of Kyle's tournaments. She went to
Carlton.” Our rival high school, one town away. “She would
have been a senior there, but her dad's company
transferred him to Boston last July.” He crinkles his nose.
“That was kind of the end of us.”
She's a year older than him. Interesting. They've been
broken up for more than three months and her picture is still
on his desk. That's interesting, too.
“We stayed in touch until school started, but then, I
guess we got busy with other things. I haven't talked to her
in a while.”
“She's pretty.” I say, running my finger along the silver
frame, wondering if blurting is allowed or frowned upon in
situations like this. I want to know about Devon. I need to
know about Devon.
I feel that familiar swirling in my mind, starting like a
whirlpool, spinning slowly, steadily, but preparing to build
and speed, fed by information and the need for more
information, until it's a full-on maelstrom.
“How long were you together?” I ask, against my better
judgment.
“Almost a year.”
“That's a long time.”
“Yeah.”
I study the picture again. Her blond hair hangs down past
her shoulders, her bangs swept to the side. There's
something about the way she's squinting her eyes, like
they're doing more than smiling, and I wonder if AJ said
something that made her laugh right before the shutter
snapped.
The questions keep coming. I can't stop staring at the
two of them. They look so comfortable together, so happy,
and I can't help but wonder if I'll ever feel that relaxed with
another person. Will a guy ever look at me the way he's
looking at her in this photo? Kurt never did. Brandon never
even thought to. AJ and Devon were a real couple. You can
tell.
I look up at him. “Did you love her?”
He studies the photo in my hands. Then his eyes fix on
mine. “Yeah.”
“Do you still?” The corners of his mouth turn down, and I
can't tell if I crossed the line or if he's simply giving his
response some serious consideration.
“I don't know.”
It's honest. I'm not upset by his answer. It's sweet,
actually, and the information is satisfying in the way I need
it to be.
I glance over at his bed, trying not to think about my
next question. It's right on the tip of my tongue, but I can't
bring myself to ask it, even though AJ's standing there,
patiently waiting for me to speak.
“Did you bring her to winter formal last year?” I ask
instead, and he gives me a funny look.
“Yeah.” After a brief pause, he asks, “Who did you go
with?”
“Kurt Frasier.”
“He seems nice.”
“He's a dick.”
“Oh.”
“Worst school dance story ever.”
“Tell me.”
“You're just trying to change the subject.”
“Yes. Desperately.”
That makes me laugh.
I drop the picture frame back behind the papers where I
found it, but it barely leaves my grasp before AJ reaches for
it and stuffs it into a drawer.
“Actually,” he says, “don't tell me. It's a really bad idea
for wimpy musician guys like me to want to physically harm
jock football players. You'll tell me he was mean to you, and
because I'm your friend”—he brushes his elbow against my
arm—“I'll see him at school and feel the need to defend
your honor, and an hour later I'll be in the ER getting
stitches in my eyebrow or something.”
I smile. “We're friends, huh?”
He takes a tiny step toward me. Close but not too close.
Friends-close. “Can we be?” he asks.
Two weeks ago, I was okay with being his friend, but
that's not what I want anymore. I like him. I like everything
about him. The way he plays. The songs he writes. The
things he says. The way he makes me want to speak out,
not hold my words inside. That dimple. Those lips. I have to
know what they feel like. Maybe this is like blurting? Maybe
I'm not supposed to think about it; I'm just supposed to do
it. But I want him to make the first move.
Please kiss me.
“Sure,” I say.
“Good,” he replies. “Friends.”
But I want more. I picture Devon again. She had more.
Then again, she probably never teased him for a stutter he
couldn't help and harassed him until he switched schools.
“I should go,” I say. I'm still standing close enough for
him to touch me again, and for a moment, I wonder if he's
going to. He doesn't move, but his eyes are locked on mine
like he's trying to read my thoughts. If he could, he'd
understand how much I want him to wrap his arms around
my waist and rest his chin on my shoulder, looking as
relaxed and happy as he did in that picture.
He takes a deep breath and blows it out slowly. “Okay,”
he finally says, and then he walks over to the door and turns
the knob, and I reluctantly follow him down the hall.
He grabs my car keys off the table in the entryway and
dangles them in front of me. “Thanks again for helping Em,”
he says.
“Of course.”
“I'll see you tomorrow.”
“See you tomorrow.”
I don't want to leave. I'm not entirely sure he wants me
to.
AJ stands on the porch, leaning against a post with his
arms crossed, watching me climb into my car. I back out of
the driveway, wondering what would have happened if I'd
been brave enough to tell him what I was really thinking.
Somewhere around midnight, I thought about taking my
sleep meds and calling it a night. But I couldn't stop
researching, and so by four a.m., I've learned a lot about
Devon Rossiter.
I've been manically opening window after window,
clicking on link after link, scanning site after site, but I'm still
following this white rabbit down the hole, trying to feed my
brain enough information to reach my own personal
wonderland.
Like Kyle, Devon's an impressive athlete, well ranked on
the varsity team. Carlton High posts everything from team
to individual player stats, so not only can I see her official
photo (again, pretty, very little makeup) I can see every
point, goal, shot, assist, and steal for every game she
played last season.
There are lots of team photos, and in each one, she's
wearing her long blond hair in a ponytail with her bangs
pulled back in a sporty-looking headband. There are a few
videos, but she's not in many of them.
Across the Internet, I've uncovered a few articles about
her. I can't figure out where she lived, but that would be
easy if I really wanted to find out. Even if my mom didn't
represent either side of the sale, I bet her laptop has all the
details. I can't tell where they live now, but I've located her
dad's new office in Boston on Google Maps.
Devon seems to be settling in well at her new school,
making friends both on and off the team. Her Facebook
page is open, so I can see everything, including a long and
photographically detailed history of her “almost a year”
relationship with AJ. There are pictures from our winter
formal—I recognize the background—and I notice that she's
wearing more makeup in these shots, but still not as much
as I wear every day. There are photos of the two of them at
the beach and the two of them at her niece's third birthday
party and the two of them at various soccer tournaments,
including one of her standing in between AJ and Kyle, her
arms draped over their shoulders. She checked in at a few
movies and tagged AJ, too.
Of course, that leads me to AJ's Facebook page, but I find
his almost completely untouched, save the times she's
tagged him. There's nothing about him here. Nothing about
music. Nothing about poetry. Nothing about his brother or
his mom, and nothing that connects him to the people in
Poet's Corner.
With every click, I feel the tightening in my stomach, the
adrenaline rush, the need to learn more—not about her,
about them. I have to understand this relationship and
what's at the root of that expression on AJ's face when he's
looking at Devon and not at the camera, which he's often
doing.
It's not jealousy. It's my OCD, this inexplicable,
uncontrollable need to know one thing, and then one more
thing, and then yet another thing, until my brain is
exhausted. And tonight, I'm having a hard time reaching
that level, because it's been hours and I still don't know
what it feels like to be in a relationship like this one—to be
that close, that connected to someone else—and I need to
figure it out in a way no one but Sue would ever understand.
Sue. If she saw what I was doing right now, she'd lose it.
I shut my laptop and let it drop to the floor next to my
nightstand. I shouldn't be doing this. Devon doesn't live
here, and she and AJ aren't together. And even if she did
and they were, he's not my boyfriend. We're barely even
friends.
My logical mind knows these things are true, but still,
when I close my eyes, there's this image of AJ and Devon
twisted up in the sheets together. His mom isn't home until
six o'clock on weeknights. His brother's never home either.
He loved her and he still might. How often did they meet at
his house after school? Did they cut classes, spending full
days together in his bed? They must have, at least once.
Serious relationship, empty house, that's what you do.
I don't want to think about the two of them, arms and
legs intertwined under his blue comforter, but I can't fall
asleep because I can't get the image out of my head.
Caroline and I are sitting in the front row of the theater in
our usual seats. I'm jittery from my lack of sleep and the
three Cokes I've had since lunch. This morning, I found AJ's
guitar pick in the pocket of my jeans, and I've been fiddling
with it ever since, like it's my thinking putty. I've already
decided I'm going to tape it up on the inside of my locker
door.
“You're freaking out about a girl he hasn't spoken to in
months,” Caroline says.
We've been trying to write a new poem, but I'm having a
hard time concentrating. I keep picturing the way AJ folded
his arms around me, his chest pressed against my back, his
warm breath on my neck. I can't stop reliving that fantasy
when I crossed the room and kissed him. I'm trying to think
about the good parts of being alone with AJ in his room
yesterday—because there were many of them—but no
matter what I do, that photograph pops into my mind every
time.
“They were together for almost a year. It was serious,
Caroline.”
“So? It's not serious now.”
I close my notebook, leaving the pencil in the binding to
mark our place, and lean back in the crushed red velvet
theater seat. “See, this is good. Keep going,” I say, curling
my finger toward me. “This is why I told you. I knew you'd
talk some sense into me. Did I tell you she's a senior?”
“Three times now.” Caroline shifts in her chair and folds
her arms across her chest. “Do you really want to hear what
I think, Sam?”
“Of course I do.” I throw my head back and stare up at
the ceiling. She doesn't say anything. I look at her, so she
knows I mean it. “Please. I want to know what you think.”
“Fine,” Caroline says. “I think he likes you.”
“You do?”
She doesn't answer my question; she just keeps talking.
“I also think you're overcomplicating this whole thing. I
think that even when good, totally normal, completely
healthy things happen in your life, like”—she starts
articulating her points on her fingers—“your new car, writing
poetry, spending an afternoon at AJ's house, meeting me…”
She sits up straighter wearing a big fake grin, then returns
to her serious tone. “You seem determined to find a way to
make them unhealthy.”
“You? I haven't turned you into anything unhealthy.”
“Maybe not yet.”
“What's that supposed to mean?”
She laughs. “You're missing the point, Sam. These are all
good things, all normal things. And rather than enjoying
them, you find a way to twist them into something toxic.”
I roll my eyes and let out a sigh. “Trust me, I want to stop
thinking. I wish I could.”
Caroline kicks her feet out in front of her and leans way
back in the chair, crossing her arms behind her head and
staring off into the distance. “You should hit baseballs.”
“Baseballs,” I say flatly.
“My dad and I used to go to the batting cages at the
park. Have you ever been?”
“I think I went when I was a little kid. It was ages ago. I
don't really remember it. Why?”
“You get in the cage all alone.” Caroline sits up straight
and begins talking louder and faster, using her hands for
emphasis. “Then you grab your bat and take your stance,
and even though you're expecting it, there's a sense of
surprise when this ball comes flying out of the machine right
at you.” She points to her head. “So you grip the bat tighter
and bring it to your shoulder. You watch the ball. Then you
step into it and swing.”
“Okay,” I say, wondering where she's going with this.
“You hear this crack when the bat connects, and then the
ball's gone, soaring off into the distance. But you can't
relax, because now there's another ball speeding your way.
So you tighten your grip, take your stance, and swing again.
And you keep going until your time runs out. By then, your
shoulder is throbbing and you're totally out of breath, but
you feel pretty damn good.”
“You're saying my thoughts are like baseballs.”
Her lips curl into a satisfied grin. “Exactly. And you, my
friend, stand there in the batting cage and let those balls
smack you in the head, over and over again. But you don't
have to.” She taps her finger against her temple. “You have
a perfectly good bat.”
“I have a broken bat.”
“Eh. It'll do,” she says. Then she leans back in the chair
again and crosses her arms, looking proud to have said her
piece. “Are you still glad you asked me what I thought?”
“Actually, I am.”
“Good. Can you be happy, please? Things are going well,
aren't they?”
They are. I can't wait to get downstairs on Mondays and
Thursdays. I'm even starting to look forward to stepping up
on that stage. I haven't had an Eights-induced thought
spiral in weeks.
“Yes.”
“You can trust them, Sam,” she says. “Let your guard
down with AJ and everyone else. And please, stop thinking
so much. You're exhausting.”
I give her foot a kick. She kicks me back. And we return
to writing.
Over the next week, I see AJ everywhere.
I pass by him between classes, and not only after second
period the way I've intentionally scheduled. At lunch each
day, I see him sitting with Emily and Cameron, and when I
catch him stealing glances at me, he quickly looks away and
pretends to be deep in conversation. I've seen him in the
student lot twice now, climbing into Sydney's car. Both
times I drove away wishing he'd climbed into mine.
On Monday, I tried to talk with him after Poet's Corner,
but he said he had somewhere he needed to be and sped up
the stairs so fast, Caroline even looked at me and said,
“Well, that was awkward.”
I'm starting to wonder if I imagined the whole thing last
week, because it's as if the two of us never chatted over
linguistics and playlists, I never saw his room or his
clipboard filled with music, and that an incredibly sexy
acoustic guitar lesson—the one I'm still obsessing about and
not even trying to block from my mind—didn't happen at all.
As I'm walking to third period on Wednesday, I see him
heading right toward me. I'm expecting one of his usual
nonchalant chin lifts, and preparing to return it with one of
my own, but instead, he slows his steps and actually makes
eye contact with me.
“Hey,” he says under his breath as he comes to a stop.
“Do you have a second?”
I nod and he waves me over to the side of the corridor
and out of traffic. He dips his head toward mine. “How are
you?” he asks.
He's not wearing a cap today, and when his hair falls
forward, I have to fight the urge to push it away from his
face. “I'm good. How are you?”
“Fine.” He looks so nervous, shifting his weight, like
maybe this isn't going the way he'd planned. Then I realize
he's picking at his imaginary guitar strings against his jeans.
I wonder if I'm fidgeting too, so I check myself and find my
hand at the back of my neck, my nails all set to dig in. I
wrap my backpack strap around my finger instead.
“I just wanted to…to see how you were doing.”
I try to think of something interesting to say—something
open-ended that we will have to continue talking about
when we have more time. But before I can speak, he
reaches out and brushes his thumb against my arm. It's not
a mistake. It's deliberate.
“I'd better get to class,” he says.
“Yeah,” I say. “Me too.”
He drops his hand and slips back into the crowd, and I
look around the corner, watching him walk away. It's all I
can do to not follow after him. I want to talk to him longer. I
want him to touch me like that again.
I bite the inside of my cheek three times and head off in
the opposite direction.
“It must be Wednesday!” Colleen chirps when I open the
door. She walks around to my side of the counter and gives
me a bottle of water. “It's been a crazy day around here.
Sue had an emergency at the hospital this morning, and
we've been running behind schedule ever since.”
It's funny. Sometimes I forget that Shrink-Sue has other
patients, let alone patients who require her to drop
everything and come to a hospital for them. I'm glad I don't
need her that much.
“Get comfortable,” Colleen says.
I stick in my earbuds, and instead of choosing my usual
waiting room playlist, I turn on Song for You. Leaning against
the wall, I mentally bring myself back to the school corridor,
happy to have a few quiet moments to think about what
happened with AJ this afternoon. He was so nervous, and so
cute, and so close to me. As music fills my ears, chills travel
through my body, and I realize I'm brushing my thumb back
and forth across my arm, exactly the way he did.
Something catches my eye, and I see Colleen waving
from behind her desk. I give a tug on the cord, and my
earbuds fall into my lap. “She's ready for you.”
I shuffle into Sue's office. She doesn't waste any time
getting down to business. “So, fill me in on your week.”
As I stretch my putty, I give her the basics. Everything
with my family is good. School's fine. The poetry's going
well, getting better, still therapeutic. We get to the
inevitable conversation about the Crazy Eights, but
surprisingly, there isn't much to tell. Things have been fairly
drama free.
“How are things with Caroline?” she asks, and today, I
don't smile like I normally do. Instead, I feel my blood
pressure spike.
“I've been thinking about her a lot this week. I'm feeling
really guilty, you know?” I picture her the way the Eights
would see her: frayed flannels and weird T-shirts, blemished
skin and stringy hair. “She's my friend. I shouldn't be
keeping her a secret.”
“Does she mind that you haven't introduced her to the
Eights?”
I shake my head. “No. I asked her earlier this week. She
told me she has no interest in meeting them.”
“What would they say if you told them about her?”
I squeeze my putty hard. “They'd feel threatened. You
know how they are about other girls. It's a loyalty thing.”
Sue writes something down in her portfolio. “Then maybe
you shouldn't tell them?”
“Is that okay?”
“It sounds like it's okay with Caroline. Is it okay with
you?”
“I guess so.” My heart starts racing again. “Actually, I
don't feel like talking about this today.”
She considers me for a moment, and then returns to her
portfolio, flipping pages back to review her notes from
earlier sessions. “How's your swimming going?”
“I've been going to the pool six days a week since school
started. I'm still swimming with the team, but I'm also
starting to swim by myself at night. It feels great. I feel
great.”
This is going to be an easy session. Sue's had a busy day.
She's behind schedule. Let's wrap it up so I can get to the
pool.
I'm trying to decide what to say next, when Sue closes
her portfolio, rests her elbows on her knees, and locks her
eyes on mine. “Why do you look so tired?” she asks.
“What?”
“How have you been sleeping?”
Sue doesn't move. I'm pretty sure she's not even
blinking. I consider cracking a joke, or coming up with an
excuse, but after a long pause, I decide to tell her the truth.
“I stopped taking my sleep meds,” I whisper.
“When?”
I blow out a breath. I know the exact date. It was the
week Caroline first introduced me to Poet's Corner. I couldn't
get AJ's song out of my head, and at some point, an
obsession with his words turned into an obsession with my
own. “Over two months ago.”
She lets out a heavy sigh. I can't see what she's writing,
but knowing she's documenting my failure makes me feel
even worse.
“You can't get by with four to five hours of sleep each
night, Sam.”
I've been doing exactly that for the last couple of
months, and I'm fine. I'm not failing my classes or anything.
Well, I might be failing Trigonometry, but that doesn't have
anything to do with the amount of sleep I've been getting.
That's entirely about me sucking at trigonometry.
“What are you working on that late at night?”
I tuck my feet underneath me and recline into the chair,
staring up at the ceiling. “Poetry,” I say, which is true, but
not entirely. Sometimes I'm writing. Sometimes I'm reading
other people's poems on the Internet. Sometimes I'm
listening to music and looking up lyrics, but that counts as a
form of poetry, doesn't it?
“Can't you do that during the day?”
I shake my head hard. “No time.” But it's more than that.
It's not that I don't have the time, it's that the time's not
right. Even when I'm writing during my swim, or in the
theater with Caroline, it's dark and quiet. I need it dark and
quiet. I need to write at night, where no one can see me.
“Sam,” she says strictly, and I smash my putty between
my fingers. “Have you stopped taking your other
medication?”
“No. I wouldn't do that, Sue.”
I remember how I used to be before we found the right
meds. I used to fixate on something—it could be anything—
something one of my teachers said, or something one of the
Eights said, or something I heard on the news. I knew the
thoughts were irrational, but one thought led to another,
and to another, and once the spiral started, I couldn't
control it.
It was horrible. I'd yell at my parents. Throw tantrums
like a six-year-old. I was tired all the time, because trying to
function while you're trying to ignore all those swirling
thoughts is physically and mentally draining. I'm still myself
on the meds, but they help me control the thought spirals. I
wouldn't go back to a life without them.
“This matters to you, doesn't it?” I must look confused,
because Sue adds, “The poetry.”
“Yeah. More than I expected it to.”
It's not only the writing I crave; it's everything that goes
along with it. It's the look of anticipation on people's faces
when I step up on that stage. It's the way Caroline tells me
I'm getting better with every new poem, that I'm finding my
voice. It's the way I can construct verses during a onehundred-
meter fly.
It's everyone downstairs, too. How invested I now feel in
their lives. How my heart aches when Emily tells us that her
mom is getting worse, not better. How Sydney's poems
always put me in a good mood. How Chelsea hits me right in
the feels with her pieces about her ex-boyfriend. It's the
way Poet's Corner is changing my life, exactly like Caroline
said it would.
More than ever before, I feel compelled to tell Sue about
that room. I feel guilty about not telling her. And, aside from
Mom, she's the only one who would truly understand how
walking into that room feels like diving into the pool; how
the paper on the walls gives me such an overwhelming
sense of peace.
But I can't break my promise.
Sue must see something in my expression, because hers
softens and she starts tapping her mechanical pencil
against her knee like she does when she's thinking.
“What if we compromise?” she asks. “I have another
sleep medication I'd like you to try. It's fairly new. It's fastacting
and has a short half-life, so it'll be out of your system
quickly. You could write until midnight, then take it, and
you'll get at least seven hours of sleep. You can write, and
also give your brain and body the rest they need. What do
you think?”
I like the idea of writing when I need to. Mostly, I like
doing it with Sue's permission. “Sure,” I say.
She hunches over and scratches out a prescription. “Take
this every night at midnight or earlier.” She hands it to me.
“Now, I have something important to say.”
Uh-oh. Here it comes.
“Things are going really well for you right now, Sam.
That's because you're making some positive changes in
your life, but it's also because we've found a treatment plan
that's working. Weekly talk therapy, medication to help you
sleep, and medication to keep invasive thoughts from
turning into anxiety attacks. You are not allowed to modify
this combination on your own.”
“Okay.”
“In the future, you talk to me before you stop taking any
of your meds. Are we clear?”
“Yes.”
“Good.” She sits up straight and crosses her legs. “Now,
is there anything else you'd like to tell me?” She folds her
hands in her lap and waits. I sneak another peek at the
clock. Crap. How could I still have thirty minutes left in this
session?
I fall back against the chair and close my eyes. “AJ,” I say
matter-of-factly.
“The one you and Kaitlyn used to tease.”
I nod.
“How long has this been going on?”
I do the math in my head. It's been more than two
months since Caroline first led me down those stairs and
introduced me to him. A month since he let me back into
Poet's Corner. A week since he invited me to his house and
declared us “friends.”
“For me? A couple of months. For him…there's nothing
‘going on' because, as with all my other crushes, this one's
completely one-sided.”
“Why do you say that?” she asks.
“We're friends.” I think about the way he touched my
arm in the hallway today, and I feel the corners of my mouth
turn up against my will. “But I like him. He's nice to me. The
whole thing feels…normal.”
“How does it feel normal?” she asks softly, using the tone
of her voice to get me to tell her more.
I want to tell her everything.
I stretch my putty in my hands, trying to decide where to
begin. Finally, I stop searching for the right thing to say—the
thing I think Sue wants to hear—and instead I just start
talking in that scary, filterless way. “I don't think I'm
obsessed with him. I mean, okay…I might be kind of fixated
on his ex-girlfriend, Devon. I started looking her up last
week, and it was pretty bad at first. But I'm starting to get it
under control.” I tell Sue about Caroline's baseball trick. Sue
writes it down.
“But so many things feel better lately. I'm not spending
half my evening wondering if I'm going to pick the wrong
thing to wear the next day. During class, I'm not worrying
that I might say something at lunch that will piss off one of
my friends so they all gang up against me and ignore me for
three days straight. For the first time in a long time, I don't
care what they think. And it's not because of this guy or the
writing or Caroline, or, I don't know, maybe it is. Maybe it's
about all those things.”
I'm getting all fired up now and I can't sit still, so I leave
my chair and walk over to the window overlooking the
parking lot.
“All I know is that I feel good about myself for the first
time in ages. I might still be obsessing, but I'm obsessing
about poetry and words. I'm swimming almost every day,
and my body feels strong and my mind is so clear. And I like
this really nice guy who might not think of me as more than
a friend, but at least he's not a jerk like Kurt, or completely
unattainable like Brandon.”
She drops her portfolio on her seat and walks over to join
me at the window.
“I'm not obsessing about my friends turning on me or
kicking me out of their little club. I no longer care if they
do.”
It feels freeing to say the words out loud, and as I do, it
occurs to me how true they are: I care more about what AJ
and Caroline and the rest of the people in Poet's Corner
think of me. If they kicked me out or stopped talking to me,
I'd be devastated, but, of course, they'd never do that in the
first place. I feel safe with them.
“And maybe it's obsession. Maybe it's not ‘normal' at all.
But I feel good when I'm with them.”
“I can tell.”
And without revealing the secret room underneath the
school theater, I spend the rest of the session telling her
about AJ, Caroline, Sydney, Cameron, Abigail, Jessica, Emily,
and Chelsea. My eight new friends.
The parking lot is practically empty. I swipe my card key
across the panel, the gate clicks open, and I step inside,
looking around and wondering why there's no one here.
Team practices ended hours ago, but even though it's after
eight o'clock, there are usually a few adults swimming laps
when I arrive. Tonight, there's one person in the pool. I'm
relieved she isn't in lane three.
I drop my swim bag on a chair near the edge and unzip
the side pocket that holds my cap and goggles. From the
main compartment, I grab my towel, and when I do, I spot
my blue notebook. It's such a nice night, so I stuffed it in
here at the last minute, thinking I might sit on the lawn and
write for a while after my workout.
I've never actually written at the pool before. My poems
come to me as I'm swimming, and I put them on paper
when I get home, but they never sound quite as good as
they did in my head. This way, I figure I won't lose my
groove.
I'm only halfway through my workout when the other
swimmer leaves the pool and heads for the outdoor shower.
A few laps later, I see her unlatching the gate and
disappearing into the parking lot.
I'm alone. I hop out of the pool and walk over to the
chair, grab my blue notebook and a pen, and set them on
the edge of the pool under the diving block.
By the end of my workout, the paper is soaked through at
one corner and some of the ink is smudged, but I can still
read my latest poem clearly. I add the final line and read the
whole thing through, top to bottom, crossing out a word
here and another there, swapping them out for better ones
as I go. When I'm done, my toes are sore from sliding them
back and forth against the wall, but I don't care. This poem
is actually pretty good.
I wrap myself up in my towel, jam my notebook back into
my bag, rinse off in the shower, and head into the locker
room to change into my sweats. I'm piling my hair into a
ponytail when my phone chirps. I grab it off the counter and
read the text:
you were really good today
It's from a number that's local but unknown. I type:
who is this?
I rest the phone on the counter next to the sink and
gather the rest of my things together. I'm throwing my bag
over my shoulder when the phone chirps again.
AJ
My bag slips to the floor and lands with a thud. I check
the string. This isn't a message to the whole group; it's a
message for me. My eyebrows pinch together as I reply.
hey
It's been two weeks since that day at his house, when he
taught me how to play guitar, told me about his exgirlfriend,
and we became friends and nothing more. I'm not
sure what to say, so I stand there, leaning against the
bathroom sink, holding the phone with both hands, and
waiting for his reply. Finally one comes.
what are you up to?
I can't really tell him that I'm standing in a semipublic
bathroom, my hair still wet from the shower, wearing sweats
and no makeup, so I fall back on what I was doing fifteen
minutes earlier.
not much. just writing
sorry. didn't mean to interrupt
you didn't
I'll let you get back, just had to tell you I really liked
your poem
Yesterday, when I took the stage for the sixth time, I read
a poem about unreliable friends, people you love and feel
bonded to but can never truly trust. It was about feeling
alone and vulnerable, and never being able to fully let your
guard down. When I read it, my voice was clear and loud
and direct, and I've never felt more confident on that stage,
but I've never felt more exposed either. Everyone clapped
and I slapped the paper on the wall, officially giving myself
another contribution to Poet's Corner. And it felt good.
Really good.
thanks
I'm not sure what to say next, but I don't want the
conversation to end, so I decide to keep it going, being
mysterious, or flirtatious, or maybe a little of both.
remember when you asked me if I had a favorite place to
write
yeah
that's where I am
As I type the words, I'm thinking about what AJ said that
day I was alone in Poet's Corner with him. When I asked him
why everyone starts by saying where they wrote their piece,
he said that the places matter, and by voicing them, they
become part of the poem. I liked that idea.
I'm intrigued…
I bite my lip. Is this still friendly chatter? Or are we flirting
now? He might be flirting. I'm not sure.
Just in case we are flirting, I wait for a minute before I
reply, letting his words hang in the air a bit longer, keeping
him “intrigued.”
are you going to tell me?
I stare at the screen for a long time, gathering my nerve
to reply with the first thing that pops into my head, which is
definitely flirtatious, no way around it. I leave the locker
room, throw my bag down on the grass, and then sit, legs
folded underneath me, thumbs hovering over the keyboard.
He's the one who keeps telling me to blurt. And blurting in a
text is way easier than blurting face-to-face. Feeling shaky
all over, I type:
want me to tell you or show you?
Before I can chicken out, I press SEND, and my heart starts
beating faster and harder than it had been when I was
swimming laps. I drop the phone on the grass and shake out
my arms, wishing I could un-send that text. But I can't. It's
out there. I can't take it back now. Crap.
I can see the screen. There's no response. He doesn't
know what to say. I pushed it too far. I wind my wet ponytail
around my finger, feeling stupid and starting to wonder if
he's ever going to reply, when the words appear in a speech
bubble on my screen:
show me.
I fall back on the grass and reach for the phone, covering
my mouth with my hand to hide the stupid grin that just
appeared out of nowhere. Play it cool. Play. It. Cool.
tomorrow night?
pick you up at 8
He'll be in my car again. I start to panic about the
odometer, but then I force the thought away with a nice
memory of the day he sat in my passenger seat, listening to
me talk about my playlists and how I named them. Telling
me how he learned to play guitar, even though it was
painful to hear. My parents would kill me if they knew I was
driving around with passengers. So would Sue. But I can't
pass up this chance. I want him to sit in that seat again, to
talk to me like he did that day.
see ya then
I stare at the screen for what feels like a long time,
wondering what this whole thing means. Wondering if it
means anything.
It's not a date. It's me showing a fellow poet where I like
to write. That's it. But the thought of bringing AJ here makes
me feel giddy and light-headed. I look around the empty
club, hoping it will be this quiet tomorrow night.
bring your swimsuit
I press SEND and wait until the ellipses finally appear on
the screen, telling me he's typing his reply.
I'm not sure I'm intrigued anymore
I laugh. I'm not ready for this conversation to end, so I
read back through the string as if that will keep it alive, and
to double-check to be sure I didn't misread anything. I don't
think I did. He started it. I kept it going and turned a friendly
check-in into something else. “It's not a date,” I say aloud
as I run my finger along the glass. “We're friends.”
Even if that's all we are, it's okay. This is already more
than I ever expected from AJ Olsen.
Last night, I took the sleep meds that knock me out for
eight solid hours, and set my alarm to wake me up fifteen
minutes earlier than usual. This morning, I showered quickly
and rushed through breakfast with Mom and Paige, all so I
could get to school early and talk to Caroline before first
bell. I can't wait to tell her about my non-date tonight with
my friend-and-nothing-more AJ.
I'm ten minutes ahead of schedule, buckling my seatbelt
and about to pull out of the driveway, when I get an all-caps
text from Kaitlyn, telling me she hates Hailey. I let out an
annoyed sigh as I put the car back in park. I should have
known the drama-free state of existence wouldn't last long.
I'm replying when I get a text from Hailey, telling me that
Kaitlyn is going to kill her. The text contains a link and I click
it. It leads me to a photo of the eight of us, taken in Sarah's
backyard the summer before third grade. We're all in our
swimsuits, but Kaitlyn is wearing her bottoms and nothing
else. It already has more than thirty likes.
I separately tell them both I'm on my way.
By the time I arrive at Hailey's locker, Kaitlyn and Alexis
are already there, screaming at her about practicing proper
judgment and considering the feelings of others. My palms
feel sweaty as I near the scene, and a horrible chill travels
up my spine when I get close enough to hear Hailey's voice
crack as she tries to defend herself without breaking down
into tears. I get it. I've been in her position before, too many
times to count.
Without even thinking about what I'm doing, I step in
front of Hailey and push Kaitlyn away, holding her at arm's
length. “Calm down, you guys.”
“Do you even know what she did?” Kaitlyn yells at me.
Then she returns her attention to Hailey. “What were you
thinking?” she screams over my shoulder.
“I thought it was funny. I thought you'd think it was
funny.” Hailey's voice is low and unsteady. “I'm sorry. I took
the picture down.”
“After it got more than fifty likes!” Alexis says, jumping in
to support Kaitlyn like she always does.
“You looked pretty,” Hailey tries, but that makes Kaitlyn
even more infuriated.
“No one's looking at my face, Hailey!”
“Oh, come on. We were little kids.”
“Kaitlyn.” We make eye contact and I don't let her go. It
feels weird. I don't think I've ever looked her in the eye with
such conviction before. “You have every right to be angry,
but you have to calm down, okay? Let's talk about this at
lunch.”
“No, Samantha!” she yells in my face. “We'll talk about it
now.”
“No, Kaitlyn. We won't.” I don't even blink.
I grab Hailey's hand and pull her away before either one
of them has a chance to respond, and steer her around the
corner, down the hallway, and over to the bathroom in the
next building. Hopefully they won't think to look for us
there. Once we're inside, Hailey slams her hand against the
bathroom door as tears start streaming down her face.
“You know what sucks?” Hailey yells. “She would have
done that to me. Or to you. And if we got upset or
embarrassed she would have called us ‘oversensitive' and
told us ‘not take everything so personally.'” She mimics
Kaitlyn's voice on that last part and nails it.
Black streaks of mascara slide down Hailey's bright red
cheeks, and I grab a paper towel from the dispenser and run
it under the cold water. I hand her the towel. “Still. You had
to know Kaitlyn would be upset. That was kind of messed
up.”
She takes the towel from me and sets it straight on the
counter. She hugs me hard.
“It was. I don't know why I did it, Samantha,” she says,
but I'm pretty sure I do. Whether it's conscious or not, I'm
guessing it has something to do with being on the bottom
rung. “Thanks for stepping in. I didn't expect you to do
that.”
My chest tightens. Hailey should expect her friend to step
in and defend her. Is this the first time I have?
I hug her back and tell her it'll be okay, because it always
is. “They'll punish you for a couple of days, but then they'll
find something else to move on to.”
“You think?”
“I'm positive. By this time next week, we'll all be
referring to it as ‘Itty-bitty-titty-gate' and laughing our asses
off.” That makes Hailey crack up. She hugs me even harder.
There's still time to chat with Caroline, so I grab the wet
paper towel off the counter and press it into Hailey's hands.
“I have to run. Clean up and go to class, okay? Try not to
think about it.” They're empty words. Of course she'll think
about it. “I'll see you at lunch.”
“Will you?” she asks.
“Will I what?”
“Be there at lunch?” She stares at me. “You've missed a
lot of them lately.”
“Have I?” Hailey raises her eyebrows like she's
wondering how I could ask such a ridiculous question.
Over the last few weeks, two missing lunches turned into
three and sometimes four. If I'm not in Poet's Corner, I'm
hiding in the first row of the theater, writing with Caroline.
“Déjà vu,” she says as she starts wiping her makeup off.
“What do you mean?”
“It's Sarah all over again. She disappeared a little bit at a
time, remember? Gone a few days here. Then a few days
there. And then she was gone for good.”
“Hailey—”
She doesn't let me finish. “Sam. I don't want you to
disappear, too. If you were gone, I don't…” She wrings the
paper towel in her hands.
“I'll be there today. I promise.” Of course I'll be there
today. It's Wednesday. But if it were Monday or Thursday, I'd
skip Poet's Corner to be sure Hailey was okay. “I'll see you
at lunch,” I repeat.
I race to my locker and take my time gathering my
books, hanging back as long as I can. But Caroline never
shows up.
I'm relieved to find the swim club parking lot completely
empty, and I pull into a spot near the front gate. The
odometer wasn't a problem. I've driven here so many times,
I know all the back roads and cheats that help me park
correctly.
“North Valley Swim and Tennis Club,” A.J. says, reading
the sign as I pull into a spot. Then he turns to me. “A pool?”
“I'm a swimmer,” I say.
“Really? I didn't know that.”
I shrug. “I currently hold the county record in butterfly.”
“No shit?”
“No shit.”
I'm feeling pretty confident as I walk to the back of the
car and pop the trunk. Throwing my swim bag over my
shoulder, I slam the trunk closed, head for the gate, and
swipe the card key against the panel. The gate clicks open,
and once we're inside, I point out the men's locker room and
tell him I'll meet him at the pool.
Two minutes later, I've washed my face, changed into my
suit, and I'm back outside again, throwing my towel on the
banister next to the showers like I always do. I've walked
around crowded meets in a swimsuit since I was six years
old, and I can't remember the last time I felt self-conscious
about it, but tonight I do. I slip into the shallow end before AJ
gets outside.
The water is warm and I dunk under, wetting my hair,
smoothing it back off my face. While I wait for him, I think
about Hailey. People made comments about that photo all
day, and by the time the final bell rang, Kaitlyn was even
more pissed at her. I make a mental note to text her when I
get home.
AJ emerges from the locker room and stands there,
shifting his weight back and forth, looking adorable and
awkward. I call his name and wave him over.
“It's freezing out here,” he says.
“The pool's a lot warmer.”
“You want me to get in?”
“You are wearing a swimsuit.” I look up at the sky. “And it
is a nice night.” The evenings have turned a little colder
over the last couple of weeks, but still…it's California. The
air has a bit of a bite, but the sky is clear and there are
plenty of stars.
AJ nods and I watch him walk to the opposite side of the
pool, past all the lane lines, and climb the ladder to the
diving board. Without hesitating, he struts to the end of the
platform and does a pencil dive. Feet first. Stick straight.
Right in. He pops up to the surface and swims toward me,
doing some kind of weird-looking hybrid stroke I've never
seen before. “Let me guess,” I say when he's close enough
to hear me. “You never took swim lessons?”
He reaches a point where he can stand and he starts
walking toward me, speaking while he tries to catch his
breath. “Not a single one. I'm a natural, right?”
I laugh. “Exactly what I was thinking.”
He leans back, resting his arms on the edge of the pool.
“This is your favorite place to write? A pool.”
Now that he says it that way, I realize how strange it
sounds. “Yeah. I used to recite song lyrics while I swam, but
ever since that first time in Poet's Corner, I've been writing
poetry while I swim laps instead.” I fall forward into the
water and with one big stroke I'm standing right next to him.
I press my palms into the concrete and lift myself out of the
pool. I can feel him watching me as I walk to the opposite
end.
I step up on the block of lane number three. As I take my
stance, I run my finger along the scratchy surface three
times, and then I dive in, pushing off with my legs as I
squeeze my arms tight against my ears. Palm over hand, I
pierce the surface and dolphin kick hard under the water—
one, two—and on three I pop up, throwing my arms over my
head. I find my rhythm: One, two, three. One, two, three.
Once I have a beat, I start thinking about words.
When AJ's legs are visible under the water, I head right
for them. I come in close, touch the wall with both hands
and push off again, swimming back to the blocks, keeping
the rhythm, and making up a poem as I go. On the other
side, I do one last turn and head back to the shallow end.
Back to AJ.
I stop a few feet short of him and stand up, panting and
trying to catch my breath. I dunk underwater and slick my
hair back off my face, feeling myself flush as I think about
what I just wrote.
AJ is taking big strides toward me, pumping his arms
exaggeratedly as he goes. When he's close enough, he
brings his hands to my shoulders and fixes his eyes on me.
“Sam McAllister! What was that? And these shoulders!” He
gives both of them a squeeze, and I wish I could sink back
under the water and die.
“I know. They're horrible and manly. My friends make fun
of them all the time.”
He looks at me sideways. “Why would they do that?”
I'd shrug, but I don't want to draw any more attention to
my shoulders. “Because they get off on the misery of
others?”
“No, I mean why would they do that? You could knock
them into next week with these.” As he steps closer, his
hands slide down my arms. I wanted to escape his grip, but
now I'm hoping he'll stay right where he is. “Do you swim
every day?”
“I do all summer, but once school starts and I get busy
with other stuff, I tend to let it slip until the school team
season begins in the spring. But this year, I decided to be
more focused. Now I swim at least six days a week. My
coach thinks I have a good chance at a scholarship if I keep
it up.” I mentally prepare myself for the heart palpitations
that typically follow statements about going away to
college, but tonight, that doesn't happen.
He looks past me, toward the far end of the pool. “And
while you were doing that,” he says, not even trying to hide
the surprise in his voice, “you were writing at the same
time?”
“No.” I lie. I can't tell him what I wrote. “I didn't write
anything this time.”
“Yes, you did. I can tell by the look on your face.”
“There's no look on my face.”
He pivots me around so he's at the deeper end of the
pool. We're eye to eye now, and it seems like we're the
same height.
“Come on…Tell me, Sam.”
Sam. I love the way he calls me that, but right now, I
wish he wouldn't. It's completely disarming.
“I can't. I wrote it in, like, twenty seconds. It sucks.”
He splashes me lightly. “Sorry. I don't have any paper.” I
try to hide behind my hands again, but he grips my arms
and gently forces them underwater, pressing them against
my sides. “You saw my songs. I've written some incredibly
lame stuff.” I start to argue with him, but he doesn't give
me any time. “Tell me, Sam.” His smile is kind, encouraging,
contagious, and that dimple…so adorable.
Another “Sam.”
I blow out a breath. Close my eyes. Breathe in again.
Everything in me tells me to stop talking, but I don't listen
like I usually do. And then another thought takes over.
Tell him.
“I didn't go there looking for you. I went looking for me.”
My voice is soft, low, and shaky. “But now, here you are, and
somehow, in finding you, I think I've found myself.”
I start to panic. I said too much. I knew I would. Caroline
was wrong about letting my guard down.
Damn blurting.
Before I can open my eyes, I feel him rest his forehead
against mine, and his hands slide around my back as he
brushes his lips lightly against mine, kissing me like I just
said the right thing, not the wrong thing. And this kiss…God,
this kiss is soft and warm and perfect, and I part my lips as
my fingers find the back of his neck. He tastes like
spearmint, and his skin smells like chlorine, and I kiss him,
remembering all the times I pictured Brandon doing this,
and how those moments never ended well. I trail my fingers
along his skin. He feels real. I let my hands wander up to his
damp hair. That feels real too.
Please, let this be real. Please, don't let me be imagining
this.
“You okay?” he asks.
He hooks his finger under my chin and tips my head back
so I have no choice but to look up at him. “See, this is where
that blurting thing of mine comes in handy,” he says quietly.
“I'll start. I'm so glad I just kissed you. I've wanted to kiss
you for weeks, long before that day at my house, and right
now I really want to kiss you again.”
He kisses my forehead, my cheek, my mouth, and I kiss
him back, but he must sense my hesitation because he pulls
away and rests his forehead on mine again. “This isn't fair. I
can't tell what you're thinking. Don't worry about getting
the words right. Tell me.”
This is a mistake. He doesn't like me; he likes the person
Caroline turned me into. He thinks I'm a normal girl who
swims and writes poetry, but I'm not. I'm obsessed with my
thoughts and I can't sleep and I count in threes. He writes
music and wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't deserve
him.
“This isn't good.” I bite my lips together, pressing them
closed to keep the rest of this thought inside me where it
belongs. I stare down at the water again, but I can see his
reflection. He's watching me, waiting for me, silently asking
me to keep going, to keep talking.
“Sam.” He runs his thumb along my cheekbone. “What
isn't good?”
As soon as I part my lips, I hear the words slip out, like
they're floating away from me all by themselves. “I like you
too much.”
He kisses me again, harder this time. “Good,” he
whispers. “I like you too much, too.”
Once we start, we can't seem to stop.
Other swimmers rarely show up after eight thirty, and
we're still the only ones here, but just in case that's about to
change, I lead AJ away from the race lanes and back over by
the diving board where there's a little more privacy. The
water's a lot deeper over here, so we both have to grip onto
the side of the pool to keep from going under, and we have
to stop kissing every few minutes so we can readjust. Each
time we do, we laugh because this whole thing is totally
unexpected and more than a little bit funny.
Kurt wasn't a very good kisser. All tongue, jabbing into
my mouth over and over again, circling way too fast. Aside
from him, I've kissed guys at parties and stuff, but all of
them were probably drunk at the time. So maybe it's an
unfair comparison, but AJ seems especially skilled.
I try not to think about how much practice he had with
Devon. I try not to think about the girls he kissed before
Devon, or the ones before that. I employ Caroline's baseball
trick, mentally swinging my bat, sending the negative
thoughts flying into the distance. It works. Soon they're
gone and there's nothing left but AJ and me, mouths and
skin and water and…I don't want it to end. It feels so
amazing to let go and lose myself this way.
He spots the ladder and slides me toward it, lifting me
onto the top rung. I take his face in my hands and wrap my
legs around his waist to keep him from drowning, and we go
right back to kissing again.
Each time one of us makes a move to leave, the other
one plants a kiss somewhere—AJ on my back as I'm
climbing the ladder, me on AJ's neck just as he's starting to
pull himself out of the water—and each time we slide back
in, picking up where we left off. When we finally agree to get
out, we make a deal and shake on it.
When we're back near the locker rooms, I step into the
outdoor shower.
“You coming in?” I ask him. I'm used to rinsing off next to
my teammates out here, but this feels different. I stop at a
showerhead and flip it on, and he finds one farther in the
back on the opposite wall.
I wash the chlorine out of my hair, stealing glances at
him as I do. AJ doesn't have a swimmer's body; his arms and
back aren't as muscular, but he's definitely not skinny like I
once thought he was. He's balanced, solid and strong all
over.
He catches me watching him. He cuts the water and I do
the same. I grab my towel and wrap it around his shoulders,
and then I ball the ends up in my hands and pull him in
close, like I once imagined Brandon doing to me. We kiss
again for a long time. Then he wraps the towel around me.
“I'll meet you back out here,” I say as I head for the locker
room.
I get dressed in the post-swim clothes I packed—yoga
pants and a fitted sweater, a big step up from the baggy
sweats and my faded hoodie I usually throw on when I get
out of the pool—and I dig through my bag until I find my
makeup kit. I carry it over to the mirror, but it seems weird
to put any of it on. He's already seen me without it for the
last hour. What's the point?
I gather my things and head for the bathroom door. AJ's
hair is still damp, but he's dressed in the clothes he wore
here. We walk through the gates and out to my car. He
shivers and I crank up the heat.
“Music?” he asks, reaching for my phone. I remind him of
my password and he makes his selection so quickly, it's as if
he went straight to Song for You and pressed play. He tosses
my phone in the console and falls back into the headrest.
The first track is an acoustic version of “Your Body Is a
Wonderland,” and he recognizes it right away. I can tell
because his eyes fall shut and he starts plucking at invisible
strings.
“Where else do you play guitar?” I ask. “Are you in a
band or anything?”
“Nope. I've never played anywhere but downstairs.”
“Really,” I ask. “Never?”
He opens his eyes and gives me an awkward grin. “Nah. I
like playing downstairs. Small group. Extremely kind. Very
forgiving.”
“You're afraid?” On stage, he's like a performer
completely in his element, playing to the crowd, pointing
and winking to cheese it up during his funnier songs. He
loves being up there. You can tell.
“I can't imagine playing for total strangers. It's not my
thing anyway. I love writing songs, plucking at strings, trying
to figure out how the words and the notes work together.”
We're both quiet, lost in our own thoughts, and neither
one of us says another word until I'm at the bottom of his
steep driveway. The odometer is on nine, so I tell him I want
to hear the rest of this song and drive around the block one
time. Then I pretend to miss his driveway. When the digits
are lined up correctly, I pull up to his garage door and put
the car in park.
His head falls to one side. “Can I ask you something?” I
brace myself for a question about my tendency to overshoot
driveways.
“Of course,” I say.
“When did you start making this playlist?”
Crap. He knows these songs are for him. Or does he? I
start to say something flip, like “Oh, this old thing? Years
ago,” but that doesn't seem right. Besides, Caroline told me
to let my guard down tonight, and when I did, things turned
out pretty well.
“After I heard you play the first time.”
“Really?”
I feel my face flush. I hope it's too dark out here for him
to tell.
“Remember when you came to my house that day?” he
asks.
How could I forget?
“After you left, I wrote something for you.”
“Really?” I'm relieved to learn that he's been thinking
about me, too, and that what happened tonight wasn't a
spur-of-the-moment thing for him either. “Can I hear it?” I
ask, watching his mouth while I wait for him to reply. I can't
help myself.
His lips look so soft when he says, “Maybe.”
But inside, I can feel myself starting to panic. I didn't plan
any of this. Tonight has been amazing. Now it's over, and I
don't know what comes next.
What happens tomorrow?
He twists in his seat and kisses me, and I try to focus on
how incredible this feels, but my heart's racing fast and not
in the good way it was back at the pool. The thought spiral
starts to take control, and I try to ignore it, but it won't let
me.
He must be able to tell I'm not fully present, because he
pulls away slightly and whispers, “What's the matter?”
Talk to him.
I bite the inside of my lower lip three times. Then I take a
deep breath. “What happens tomorrow?”
His hands are warm on the back of my neck. “What do
you want to happen tomorrow?”
I want to be alone with you again. Exactly like this.
“I don't know. Tonight has been so…unexpected. Perfect.
But unexpected.”
“And you don't want to tell your friends about me?”
They wouldn't understand.
“It's not that…I just…I'm not sure I'm ready to share…
whatever this is…”
“‘Whatever this is'?” he says, laughing under his breath.
He pulls me toward him. “Do you want this?” he asks in his
candid way. “Whatever it is?”
So much.
“Yeah.”
“So do I.” He kisses me slowly, softly, and I slip right back
into him, wishing I could slow down time and savor this
moment a little bit longer.
“Then let's keep it to ourselves for a little while,” he says.
“Until we figure it out.”
It's like the knot in my chest is unraveling, and now it's a
lot easier to breathe. “Okay,” I whisper.
“Besides,” he says, “it might be kind of fun to have a
secret.”
Can I handle another secret? I'm already keeping
Caroline from the Crazy Eights, my OCD from everyone but
Caroline, and Poet's Corner from Shrink-Sue.
Sue.
I can't keep him a secret from Sue. I'm going to have to
tell her about AJ and me, and what happened at the pool
tonight. But she'd see this as healthy, right? I slip my fingers
under the hem of his T-shirt and touch his skin. He sure
doesn't feel unhealthy.
The song changes to one of my favorites, Led Zeppelin's
classic “Bron-Yr-Aur,” and AJ lets out a sigh as he turns up
the volume. “Wow. You know this?” His fingers brush against
my waist and he hums along with the tune. “I haven't
thought about this song in ages. I'll have to learn to play it
for you.”
I'm not in any hurry to see his ex-girlfriend-filled
bedroom, but I am eager to hear him again. I'd cross the
room and kiss him while he played, for real this time.
He grabs his swimsuit from the backseat. “Thanks for
showing me where you write.”
“Thanks for not laughing at my poem.”
“I'd never laugh at you,” he says. “Well, not unless you
said something funny.” He kisses me. And then he opens the
door and steps out of the car. “Good night, Sam.”
“Good night, AJ.”
He gives me a wave before he disappears inside the
house, and I sit there for a moment, collecting myself. Then
I reach for my phone, set “Bron-Yr-Aur” on repeat, and listen
to it all the way home, imagining him sitting on his bed,
playing for me.
I'm scanning the corridors for AJ while trying not to look like
I'm scanning the corridors for anyone. I'm also trying to
keep a straight face, but when I think about what happened
at the pool last night, I just…can't.
AJ's lips were as soft as I thought they'd be, and they
were so warm, so wet from the water, and the way his
hands moved so fluidly over my body…No one has ever
touched me like that before…and I have no idea how I'm
going to get through this day. And he likes me. Too much.
How am I supposed to keep him a secret? I swear if I turn
this corner and see him standing at my locker, I'm going to
press my whole body against his and kiss him hard before
he even knows what's happening.
I turn the corner and my stomach drops instead. He's not
there, but the Eights are, each one demonstrating her
dissatisfaction in her own unique way: a hip popped to one
side, a head cocked knowingly, an eyebrow raised. Hailey's
posture is less confrontational, but the nervous look on her
face makes me question if she knows which side she's on.
“Hey. What's up?” My voice cracks.
“We need to talk to you.” As soon as the words leave
Alexis's mouth, the adrenaline kicks in. My armpits already
feel sweaty, and my fingers are tingling. As usual, she has
taken the role of group representative. The one who will
“start the conversation.”
“Where have you been?” she asks.
I look around me. “Home. The parking lot. What are you
talking about?”
“Not today.” It comes out in a huff, and she doesn't add
the word “idiot” but she says it with her eyes. She rests her
hands on her hips and takes a deep breath. “Samantha, we
need to talk to you about the way you've been lying to us.”
I start to interject, but she puts her finger to her lips.
“Don't say anything until I'm done, please. You've been
lying to us. We just want to know why, because we”—she
waves her hands around, indicating the rest of the group
—“are your best friends. At least, we thought we were.”
This might be a new record. We're barely twenty-four
hours away from “Itty-bitty-titty-gate” and it's already a
distant memory. They've found a reason to move on. To me.
My hands are shaking, my pulse is racing, and a big part
of me wants to take off running right now, bound for the
theater or some other dark location where I can sit and
breathe and think and prepare for this. I'm no good in an
ambush.
Alexis looks over at Kaitlyn. This is the point at which
they've agreed to pass the baton to the next person. It's the
biggest job, the one with all the heavy lifting. “You told us
you were going to start swimming during lunch, but we
know you haven't been.”
“Your hair is never wet when you get to fifth period,”
Olivia interjects.
“I wear a cap,” I say under my breath.
“We've tried to find you at the pool,” Hailey adds. “You
haven't been there.”
I look at her. This would have been good information to
know yesterday. I have a feeling she knew this was coming,
and I feel even more betrayed.
I stuck up for her.
“So you've been spying on me?” I ask them.
“No,” Kaitlyn says plainly.
“Yes,” I say.
Alexis steps forward. “Fine. We were spying on you, but
you lied to us and that's so much worse.” Her voice pierces
the air. Everyone within earshot has stopped collecting their
books from their respective lockers and they're all frozen in
place, watching the drama unfold, waiting to see what's
going to happen next.
Over Olivia's shoulder, I spot Caroline, watching the
scene from behind her locker door, and I can read the
expression on her face: she's worried I'll tell them about
Poet's Corner.
I give her the slightest nod and hope she knows what it
means: I have this under control.
“Friends don't lie to each other, Samantha,” Kaitlyn says.
“Not ever.”
No. Never.
Not even when they don't like the outfit you're wearing
or your new haircut or the new song you like or the guy you
think is cute. My friends—especially Kaitlyn—don't lie to
each other, not ever, even when it's a kindness designed to
spare someone's feelings.
“We're giving you a chance to come clean,” Olivia says.
“Where have you been going during lunch?”
I start to panic, but instead, I think about my
conversation with Shrink-Sue last week, when I told her I
care a lot less about what my friends think of me these
days. I try to reconnect with the part of me that said and
truly meant those words. I blow out a breath and lift my
shoulders, standing a little taller.
“Honestly?” I say, and they all unconsciously lean in, step
forward, move closer toward me. “It's personal.”
“Personal?” Alexis asks. “What the hell does that mean?”
“It means it's none of your business, Alexis.”
My voice is clear, my words direct, and my hands are
already shaking less. Their eyes say everything they're
feeling: confused, shocked, humbled, hurt.
This sucks. And it feels good at the same time.
I square my shoulders and step toward my locker. Alexis
and Hailey part to let me through.
“Seriously? You're not going to tell us?” Alexis asks, and I
can hear the surprise in her voice. This scenario never
occurred to her.
“No, I'm not,” I say, spinning the combination lock, lifting
the latch, gathering my books. Using the opportunity to take
a few deep breaths and get my legs to stop trembling.
The bell rings. Thank God.
I sneak another glance over Olivia's shoulder. Caroline is
still watching us, but the expression on her face is now filled
with relief. She might even look a little proud of me. I glance
around at the Eights, wishing they'd leave so I could talk to
her, but everyone seems to be in a state of shock.
The picture on the inside of my locker door catches my
eye. My gaze travels past the pink Post-it that reads “What
you see…” and over to the small mirror. I notice that the two
expressions are nearly identical. Confidence. That was the
word I used when I told Shrink-Sue what I liked about the
photo. It's how I felt at the pool with AJ last night. It's how I
feel during lunch on Mondays and Thursdays.
I look at that strong, determined expression on my face. I
remember exactly what I was thinking when Sue asked me
about it. Swim scholarship. A chance to go far away to
college. A chance to reinvent myself. And that's when I
realize that, as much as I want the scholarship, I don't need
to go away to reinvent myself. I've already been doing that.
I turn to face them. “I'm doing some different things
during lunch now, but when I'm not, I'd still like to sit with
you guys. Is that okay?”
“Of course,” Hailey says right away. No one else says a
word, until she turns her head and raises her eyebrows at
Alexis.
“Yeah,” Alexis says. “Of course that's okay. Why wouldn't
it be?”
“Cool.” I close my locker door. “I'll see you later.”
As I pass Caroline, I motion toward the path that leads to
the theater. She follows me, and as soon as we duck into a
quiet alcove, she gives me a high five.
“Nicely done. How do you feel?” she asks.
“Amazing. But that's only part of the reason why.” I scan
our surroundings to be sure we're still alone. “Can you keep
a secret?” I ask her.
She rolls her eyes. “Of course I can.”
And I tell her all about AJ and our non-date.
I've positioned myself in line so I'll be the last one through
the door. When I pass AJ, I feel his fingers brush against my
waist, and I slow down so they can linger a moment longer. I
want to kiss him right now, right here, right in front of all the
other poets. We've been keeping “whatever this is” under
wraps for two weeks now, and I'm not sure I can handle it
much longer. It's all I can do to walk away from him.
“Are you reading today?” Sydney asks as we head toward
the couches.
“No.” I can't read. All my poems are about AJ now. They'd
know immediately. “You?”
She waves an Auntie Anne's pretzel wrapper in the air,
then takes it with both hands and snaps it taut. “You should
prepare yourself, my friend, because I'm about to wax
poetic on the many virtues of cinnamon, sugar, and butter
on warm dough. This—” She snaps the paper again. I can
see her handwriting scrawled on it. “This may be my finest
work yet.”
Sydney sits in her usual chair. Abigail's already taken the
seat next to Jessica. Caroline's not here yet, but I see an
open spot next to Emily, and I decide to sit with her today
instead. She and AJ are friends, and eventually, when the
two of us aren't a secret anymore, it would be nice to know
her better. She scoots over to make a little more room for
me, but she doesn't make eye contact.
Before we start, I take a moment to scan the room and
take it all in like I always do. I feel safe here now, not
overwhelmed or unworthy, and the familiarity feels
comforting. Still, Poet's Corner feels magical. I hope it
always does.
I have nine poems on these walls. Nine.
Cameron's on stage alone. I've never seen him up there
without Jessica and Abigail. He adjusts his glasses and
opens a piece of paper. “I wrote this in my room last night,”
he says, and then he reads a poem that's heartbreaking and
angry, and it takes me completely by surprise. I hold my
breath as he reads the last line, wondering what's ripping
him apart from the inside out. His face is bright red as he
slaps his poem hard against the wall.
“Is he okay?” I whisper to Emily.
She leans in close and tells me that his parents are
getting divorced. “He hasn't talked about it in a while.
Jessica and Abigail have been trying to take his mind off it
with ‘The Raven.'”
“I had no idea.” He's always so on, one of those people
who seems to have his life together at all times. Now I have
a lump in my throat. I thought I knew him better than this,
but I realize I don't really know anything about him at all. I
make a mental note to go read his poem now that I have
proper context. Maybe it'll help me figure out the right thing
to say to him as we're leaving today.
“Who's next?” AJ asks from his usual spot. We all look
around. Sydney's directly across from me and I see her start
to stand. Her timing's good. After that, we could use some
comic relief.
But then I hear Emily say, “I'll go,” from my other side.
She steps up onto the stage, and I realize how different
she looks today. She didn't even try to cover up the thick
dark circles under her bloodshot eyes, and if she brushed
her hair this morning, she got caught in an especially strong
wind between then and now.
“I've had a really tough week,” she says, her voice
cracking on the last word. My stomach knots up.
“This is called ‘On My Way to You,'” she says. “I wrote it
last night in my mom's hospital room.”
I'm pretty sure we're all wondering how she's going to
get through a whole poem, but she takes a deep breath, sits
straight up on the stool, and launches in, voice steady and
strong.
I drag my feet on my way to you.
Way over there.
Too far away.
Skin. Thin, practically translucent.
Eyes. Sunken. Skeletal. Bruised.
Tubes. Colorless and everywhere.
You. Not you.
Gone. Not gone.
Not yet.
Hand. Warm. Slack.
But still familiar.
So familiar.
I shouldn't have dragged my feet.
I look back at Caroline. She has her palms pressed into
the couch cushions and her gaze fixed on the floor. Sydney
has her hand over her mouth.
Tears are flooding down Emily's face when Jessica hurries
up to the stage. She hugs her hard, then looks right into her
eyes and says something the rest of us can't hear. She
hands her a glue stick, and Emily finds a spot on the wall for
her poem.
The room is quiet for a long time after that. Across the
aisle, I can see Sydney playing with her Auntie Anne's
wrapper, folding and unfolding it, before she finally shoves it
under her leg.
“Okay, someone please go,” Emily says. No one moves or
says a word. “I already saw the wrapper in your hand, Syd.”
Sydney shifts in her seat, looking around, assessing the
tone of the room, trying to figure out what to do. We make
eye contact.
You should read, I mouth, and she makes a face, like
she's not sure. I gesture toward the stage and mouth read
again.
Sydney walks to the front. Once she's settled on the
stool, she looks out into the crowd. “This is dedicated to my
friend Emily. Who, I bet, has never enjoyed the sweet, sweet
goodness of Auntie Anne's.”
Emily's still dabbing her eyes, but now she's shaking her
head, and laughing too.
“I call this one ‘Pretzel Logic,' and I'm sure it won't
surprise you that I wrote it”—she snaps the bag taut again
—“at my favorite aunt's house.”
At Auntie Anne's, I always ask for
soft, sugary, slippery sweet
pretzels. Perfectly prepped and pinched,
rolled into rings and ribbons,
twisted into tantalizing tastes that tease my tongue and
deliciously, delightfully destroy my diet.
Sydney pulls her skirt to one side, curtsying while
everyone claps and whistles. She looks directly at Emily.
“Better, darling?”
“Much.”
“I'll bring you a cup of cinnamon sugar nuggets
tomorrow. Crappy mall food cures everything.”
I cringe at the word “everything” because I'm quite
certain nothing they sell at the mall cures cancer. But Emily
blows Sydney a dramatic kiss, making it clear she wasn't
offended by her choice of words.
Sydney runs the glue stick along the back of the wrapper
and steps off the stage. She hands it to Emily. “Will you find
a home for this piece of alliterative genius, please?”
Emily's smiling as she sticks the poem to the wall next to
the one she just read about her mom. Sydney sits next to
me.
“Was that okay?”
“It was perfect,” I tell her. “And yes, your finest work
yet.”
“Thanks. I thought so too.”
The sound of a guitar pulls my attention back to the
stage. I'm still trying to get my bearings after Emily's poem,
but AJ's there now, perched on the stool with his guitar
slung over his shoulder in that confident musician way that
makes me feel light-headed.
He's plucking at the strings, just like he did in his room
on that day, but the tune doesn't sound familiar. “I haven't
written anything new in a few weeks,” he says. “I don't
know why. I guess I haven't felt like it.”
My heart's already been through enough today, but his
words make it sink even deeper into my chest. My yellow
notebook is almost full because of him. He's all I think
about, all I write about. Doesn't he want to write about me?
“A few weeks ago, a friend of mine reminded me about
this song,” he says, his music still floating around the room.
“I've always loved it, but I didn't know how to play it, so I
decided to learn, and it's felt like a bit of an escape, I guess.
Like a…vacation.”
The strings he plays begin to morph into something new,
and slowly, I start to recognize the first notes of “Bron-Yr-
Aur.” I wrap my fingers around the edge of the cushion and
squeeze.
“You guys know I love words, but this song reminded me
that sometimes they're not necessary.” He settles back
against the stool and plucks those notes again, but this time
he keeps going, playing the next ones.
His eyelids are lightly closed, his head moving gently up
and down with the rhythm. Then he opens his eyes and his
gaze settles on me, and like the song, he doesn't need any
words because that look on his face speaks volumes.
This song is for me.
He gives me the smallest smile and turns away before
anyone notices.
When he plays the last note, we all stand, clapping and
cheering as he throws his guitar over his shoulder in that
sexy way he does, and pulls a scrap of paper out of his
pocket. “I wrote out the music,” he says. Even his musical
notes have that signature AJ slant to them.
He steps off stage and heads straight for Emily. He holds
her face in his hands and says something I can't hear, and
then she points at a sliver of empty wall space on the other
side of the poem she read today. “Right there,” she says.
I can't stop watching him. He's so kind to her. And
Emily's looking at him with such gratitude.
AJ slaps his song on the wall. Then he pulls Emily into a
hug, and she clings to him like she can't let go. I can hear
her crying, working hard to catch her breath. AJ tightens his
hold on her.
Then Abigail stands up and wraps her arms around the
two of them. Jessica joins, and so do Cameron and Chelsea.
Sydney grabs my hand and we step into the circle.
Caroline's on my other side, one hand on Chelsea's back
and the other on Jessica's.
Without thinking about it, I'm moving toward Cameron
and tightening my grip on Sydney. Tears are rolling down my
cheeks, because my heart is breaking for a girl I didn't even
know three months ago.
I glance over at Caroline. She smiles wide and mouths,
Told you.
We're sitting on my living room rug, doing homework at
the coffee table, when AJ scoots closer, runs his hand
around my back, and starts kissing my neck.
“Sam,” he murmurs.
“Yeah.”
“I think we should tell people.”
That's when I realize this isn't the beginning of the
typical post-homework making out on my living room rug
we've been doing nearly every day for the last two weeks. I
don't know how to respond, so I kiss him, but my mind's off
somewhere else, caught up in a thought spiral that's a lot
like the guilty one I have about Caroline, but worse.
AJ isn't like the guys the Eights go out with. He's not
popular. He's not his brother, deemed acceptable even
though he's a year younger, because he's not an athlete in
any way. He doesn't dress like our clean-cut jock friends,
especially when he wears that ski hat (which I admit, I find
kind of sexy). He walks around campus with his head down,
avoiding interaction, and he eats lunch with two people who
appear to be his only friends: Cameron and Emily.
Of course, none of this is the real AJ, but that's the AJ
they'll see.
He reaches over, grabs me by the waist, and pulls me
onto his lap so I'm straddling his hips, and I wrap my arms
around his shoulders and bury my fingers in his hair. I look
at him, seeing him the way I do: slightly scruffy but beautiful
inside and out.
“There's a reason I think we should start telling people,”
he says.
“Oh?” I ask curiously.
“Devon called me last night.”
“Oh,” I say, already panicking.
She knows I've been researching her….Okay, stalking
her. “Did she call for any particular reason?” I ask, hoping I
don't sound jealous, or worse, freaked out.
Caroline's baseball trick works a lot of the time, but I'm
still checking on Devon. A lot. And I want to stop, but I can't,
because telling someone with OCD to stop obsessing about
something is like telling someone who's having an asthma
attack to just breathe normally. My mind needs more
information. The rabbit hole still hasn't come to an end.
“No. She called to say hi. To see how I'm doing.”
Breathe. She called to say hi.
“And you told her about us?”
“No, but I wanted to. I think I should.”
Breathe. He wanted to tell his ex-girlfriend about us.
“I'd want her to tell me if she had a serious boyfriend.”
Serious.
I bring my hand to the back of my neck and dig my
fingernail in three times, but I don't know why I'm upset.
This is good.
“What's the matter?” AJ asks.
“Nothing.”
“Yes, there is. I can tell. Your forehead gets all crunched
up when you're thinking too hard.” He kisses my forehead
and I feel the muscles relax under his touch.
One. Breathe.
Two. Breathe.
Three. Breathe.
I know what I need: information about the two of them.
Information I can't find on my own.
“I need to ask you something,” I say, interlacing my
fingers behind his head, forcing them to stay still and not
scratch against anything. I look right into his eyes. “You
loved her. Last time I checked, you weren't sure if you still
did.”
I bite the inside of my lower lip three times and hope he
doesn't notice.
“I did love her,” he says. “But I don't anymore, not like
that. I mean, I still care about her, but…” He's fumbling
through this but he sounds sincere. “Trust me, you don't
have any reason to be jealous, Sam.”
Not jealous. Just obsessed.
I start to correct him, but then it occurs to me that I'm
better off leaving this where it is.
“Seriously, I don't know how to explain it,” he says, “but
this…” He wraps his hands around my waist and kisses me,
pulling me closer to him. “This is different.”
The thoughts are already losing some of their power.
Maybe with a little more information, I can kill them
completely. “How is this different?” I ask.
“I never told Devon about Poet's Corner. She never met
any of my friends, not even Cameron. She knew I played
guitar, but I never showed her my songs or anything.” He
laughs under his breath. “That day you were in my room
and I handed you my clipboard…It kind of surprised me. I've
never done that before.”
“Really?”
“Really. We're just…different, Sam. In every way that
matters.”
We.
He doesn't say we're better. He doesn't say he loves me
more than he loved her. And that's okay; he doesn't need
to, because now his fingers are in my hair and his mouth is
on mine, and my thoughts are all about him and this
different thing we have, and my toxic Devon-thoughts are
scattering away in all directions. They might return, but I no
longer feel the impulse to check on her. The rabbit hole has
come to an end—at least for now—and I've landed in
wonderland, a peaceful place where my mind can finally
relax and quit pleading for information.
“Thank you,” I whisper, not necessarily to him, but of
course that's how it comes out.
“You're welcome,” he says, kissing me with even more
intensity. I feel his hands travel underneath the back of my
shirt, his fingers pressed into my skin, inching my hips
toward him.
“You should stay for dinner,” I say, pulling my hands
away and attempting to change the subject. “Paige keeps
asking about you.”
“Will your mom mind?”
“Only if she walks in and catches us like this.”
“I'll take my chances.” He takes both of my wrists,
guiding them around the back of his neck, positioning my
arms right where they were. Then he kisses me again,
moving slowly from my lips to my cheek to that spot right
behind my ear that he knows I can't resist. And when I'm
sure he can't see me, I bring one hand to my jeans and
scratch my leg three times.
“I think we should tell people,” I say.
“Hey, Colleen. Happy Wednesday!” I say, closing the door
to Sue's office behind me. Even from where she sits behind
her desk, I can tell Colleen's taken aback, like we're actors
in a play and I just went off script. For the last five years,
she's had the first line.
“Hi, Sam.” She stands, eyeing me suspiciously. “Water?”
“No, thanks.” I rest my elbows on the counter and she
stares at me, a smile teasing the corners of her mouth.
“Then go on in. She's ready for you.”
I feel a bounce in my step as I walk down the hallway
toward Sue's office. I've been eagerly awaiting our session,
and I can't wait to see the expression on her face when I tell
her what I've decided to do.
“Hi, Sam.”
“Hey.” I kick off my shoes and sit down, folding my legs
underneath me. Sue hands me my thinking putty, but I just
hold it with one hand and squeeze a few times. I'm not sure
I need it today. I'm light, not fidgety. Excited, not nervous.
The whole thing feels a little strange.
Sue stares at me for a good thirty seconds before she
says anything. “Well, you certainly look happy today. I take
it you're having a good week?”
I nod, but “good” doesn't really capture it.
Ever since the lying/spying incident a couple of weeks
ago, the Eights have been especially nice to me. Alexis
keeps complimenting me on my outfits, and she seems to
actually mean it. Last week, Kaitlyn asked me if I wanted to
co-chair the junior prom committee with her, and I think she
was genuinely happy when I said yes. And when Olivia's dad
got last-minute VIP tickets to a Metric concert, she invited
me to join them.
Caroline came over to my house after school yesterday,
and we sat in the backyard working on a new poem. It was
about opening your mind, lowering your walls, and finding
friendship where you least expect it. I've been trying to
write it on my own for weeks now, but I couldn't seem to
find the right words. As usual, Caroline knew exactly how to
make it better.
And then there's AJ. I was terrified when he suggested
telling people about us, but if I don't think about the “glass
half empty” parts—like the Crazy Eights' reaction or making
things weird with the Poets—and concentrate on the
positive elements—like the two of us walking to class
holding hands and kissing whenever we want to—it makes
me giddy.
When I fill Shrink-Sue in on everything, she says, “Well,
no wonder you're in a good mood.” She closes her leather
portfolio and leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees,
giving me her full attention. I can't read her expression, but
she's waiting and listening, urging me to keep talking,
without saying a word.
“I've been thinking about our conversation a few
sessions ago,” I say, forming my putty into a cube. “I told
you I didn't care what the Eights think, but that's not
entirely true. I do care. AJ and Caroline and the rest of my
new friends shouldn't be a secret. It doesn't feel right.”
“I like the sound of that.” Sue's smile is huge and warm
and contagious. She looks so proud of me right now.
And I should feel proud of myself, but there's something
below the surface that's nagging me, and I can't pinpoint it.
“Why are you scratching?” Sue asks. I pull my fingernails
away from the back of my neck and stab them into my putty
instead.
“I'm nervous.”
“What are you most afraid about?”
It's a good question. I'm not afraid of the Eights kicking
me out of the group, although it's entirely possible they will.
And I'm not afraid of them coming after Caroline or AJ
anymore. I wouldn't let that happen.
I look at her. “They're not going to understand what I see
in him.”
God, that sounds so shallow. And horrible.
“Tell me what you see in him.”
“I've told you,” I say, shifting to pull my legs to my chest
and resting my chin on my knees. “He's wonderful.”
“What's so wonderful about him?”
She's not going to let this drop. I shake my head and look
past her, out the window, watching a tree limb whipping
around in the wind. “I don't know. I can't explain it.” I
stretch out my putty and say the first thing that pops into
my head. “He plays guitar, and, well…that's just hot.” I hide
my face behind my hand so she can't see my pink cheeks.
“I'm sure it's extremely hot, but I was sort of hoping for
something less superficial.”
“Fine.” I stop fidgeting and give her my undivided
attention. “I'll give you ten non-superficial reasons.” I hold
my thumb in the air and begin counting. “He writes
thoughtful, funny, inspiring words. When he picks up his
guitar, my heart starts racing before he even touches a
string. People pay attention to him when he talks. He's
humble. He kisses really well. He thinks my man-shoulders
are sexy.”
I stop, waiting for a reaction to those last two, but Sue's
still in the same position, wearing the same expression. I
hold up a seventh finger. “He's kind to people, especially his
friends. When he talks about his family, you can tell that he
genuinely likes them. He can't swim. At all.” I laugh,
picturing that hybrid dog-paddle thing he did that night I
took him to the pool. Then I blush, remembering how he
kissed me in the water that night. How I wrapped my legs
around his waist in the deep end, both of us clothed but kind
of acting like we weren't.
“That's nine,” Sue says.
I drop my feet to the floor and sit up again. “When I'm
with him, Sue, I don't feel sick or labeled or broken. I feel
normal. He makes me feel totally and completely normal.”
She leans forward. “Does he know about your OCD,
Sam?”
I stare at her. Didn't she hear what I said? Didn't she hear
the tenth thing?
“Of course not. The second he finds out, I cease to be
normal. He makes me feel normal because he thinks I am
normal.”
Sue doesn't seem to know what to say to that. She
crosses her legs and sits back in her chair. “If he's all those
wonderful things you said about him, he'd understand,
wouldn't he?”
“I'm sure he would, but that's not the point.”
I think about that day we stood in his living room and he
said, “Everyone's got something. Some people are just
better actors than others.” I came so close to telling him my
something. But I chickened out. If I told him back then and it
scared him away, that would be one thing, but now there's
too much at stake.
I can't lose him.
“You once told me that my OCD was made worse by the
people I chose to have in my life. You've wanted me to
distance myself from the Eights, to find new, less toxic
friends, and I have. We can be the ‘Poetic Nine' or some
other stupid moniker, I don't care. I like them. I like who I
am when I'm with them. I'm getting better at saying what I
think. I'm not as afraid of my thoughts, maybe because I'm
not holding on to them so tightly anymore. I feel like my
mind is under control now. Like I'm…better.”
“What does that mean to you, Sam? To be ‘better'?”
Sane. Healthy. Not sick. Not crazy.
“Someone normal! Someone who doesn't need
medication to sleep or keep her thoughts under control.
Someone who doesn't need you.”
I clap my hand over my mouth, but it's too late. “I'm so
sorry,” I say into my palm.
“You have nothing to be sorry about.” Sue's expression
barely changes, but she's quiet for a long time.
What have I done?
“Have I ever told you about Anthony?” she finally asks.
I shake my head.
“He was a patient of mine many years ago. He had
synesthesia. It's a disorder where, in essence, your five
senses have their wires crossed. In this case, Anthony could
hear in color.”
“I'll trade him,” I say. “That sounds really cool.”
“It wasn't to him. It affected his daily life. He had a hard
time concentrating at work, especially in meetings when
there were multiple people speaking at the same time. He
couldn't tolerate crowds. He felt like his brain was on
overload, constantly receiving stimuli. It was physically
draining.
“We worked together for a long time, and after a while,
his perspective started to change. He began to realize no
one else heard music quite the way he did. No one else
knew that his wife's voice was this really unique shade of
purple. ‘Normal' people couldn't see the color of laughter,
and he began to feel sorry for them, because they'd never
get to experience the world the way he did. I think that's a
lovely way to look at special minds.”
I roll my eyes. “Really, Sue? Special?”
“Very. Your brain works differently, Sam. Sometimes it
does things that scare you. But it's very special, and so are
you.”
“Thank you.” I smile at her. It's a kind thing to say. But I
know where she's going here. “You're sharing this story to
make me tell AJ, aren't you?”
“I'm not making you do anything. Whether or not you tell
him is entirely up to you. I'm merely reminding you to
embrace who you are and surround yourself with people
who do the same.”
“Okay.”
“And you know what's totally ‘normal'?” she asks. “To
feel the way you're feeling right now. It's okay to want a life
without medication. And a life without me.”
“I'm sorry I said that.”
“Don't be. I'm incredibly proud of you, Sam. You're doing
great.”
I am. And it feels good. But I'm still not about to tell AJ
my secret.
The next night, my phone chirps as I'm sprawled across my
bed, doing my French homework. I pick it up and check the
screen.
P.C.
“P.C.?” As in Poet's Corner? It's seven forty-five on a
Thursday night. That can't be right. I check the recipients of
the group message and see the long list of phone numbers.
I wait for someone else to reply, but no one does, so I
type:
Is this a mistake?
I press SEND, and AJ responds right away.
No.
My pulse is racing as I leap off my bed and slip out of my
sweats and into a fresh pair of jeans and a clean sweater.
It's freezing outside, so I throw my swim parka over my arm.
I grab my swim bag off the floor and my car keys off my
desk.
Mom, Dad, and Paige are sitting together on the couch
watching a movie. “I'm going to go swim some laps,” I
announce, feeding my arms through my jacket and hoping I
look convincing.
“This late?” Dad asks, and before I can say anything,
Mom chimes in and says, “She always swims this late.” She
waves me off. “Have fun.”
I'm feeling a little guilty as I put the car in reverse and
back out of the driveway, and a lot guilty as I drive right
past the street that leads to the pool, but guilt turns to
nervousness as I pull into the student lot. I drive to a spot
that allows me to park with the odometer on three.
AJ's waiting for me inside the gate. He spreads his arms
wide. “Welcome to your first P.M.”
“Do I even want to know what a P.M. is?” I don't like this.
I'm not good with surprises.
“Every once in a while we meet at night, just to shake
things up. They're fun. You'll see.”
He checks the surroundings to be sure we're alone, and
then he reaches out and grabs the zipper on my swim
parka. He gives it a tug, pulling me toward him. “You look
gorgeous, by the way.”
I laugh in his face. “That's not possible. I was doing
homework and I rushed out the door. I didn't even put any
makeup on.”
“Like I said…” He slowly unzips my parka down to my
waist and slips his arms inside and around my back, pulling
me closer, pressing his body against mine. “Gorgeous,” he
whispers. He tips his head down and kisses me, and my lips
part for him like they always do. I'll never get enough of
this. I'll never get tired of kissing him.
I want to stay out here, alone with him for the next hour
or two, but I know everyone's inside. And besides, it's
freezing. He slides his arms away, zips my jacket up to my
chin, and kisses my nose.
“That's mean,” I say. “How am I supposed keep my hands
off you now?”
“You don't have to. We could tell them tonight.”
I think about my conversation with Sue yesterday. We
could. I want to. But I've been mentally preparing to tell the
Eights first. I haven't even thought about how to tell
everyone downstairs.
“Never mind,” he says before I can respond. He kisses
my forehead. “We'll tell them later.”
He drops the subject and picks up my hand instead,
leading me to the theater door. I'm surprised it's unlocked,
and I give him a questioning look.
“I texted Mr. B and asked him to leave it open tonight.”
He drops my hand before we step into the dark theater. I
can see them up on stage, all huddled together under the
dim lighting, and I do a quick count of the shadows. Seven.
Everyone's here.
For some reason, we're all keeping silent, sneaking as
quietly as we can through the door and down the stairs. It's
strange to be in the theater at night, but it really shouldn't
feel that different; these hallways are always dark and dimly
lit, even in broad daylight. When AJ unbolts the door,
everyone slips inside and heads straight for the lamps,
flipping them on until they light up our paper walls.
I sit on one of the couches at the back of the room, and
Caroline settles in next to me. “I'm nervous,” I whisper when
I'm sure no one's paying attention. “This is weird.”
She spreads her arms across the back of the sofa, and
when her flannel falls open, I can read her T-shirt: CONSIDER
THIS DIEM CARPED.
“Stop worrying. This is a good thing. Don't twist it into
something else,” she warns.
AJ and Sydney both step onto the stage at the same
time. When he looks at her sideways, as if he's wondering
what she's doing up there, she bumps his hip with hers.
“Before we get started, I have an announcement to make.”
She waves a thin stack of papers in the air.
“There's an open-mic night at this small club in the city
tomorrow. All ages. Anyone's invited to read. Or sing,” she
says, looking pointedly at AJ and then back at the group.
She gives the flyers to Emily, who starts passing them
around.
“Larger stage than this,” Sydney says, tapping her foot
against the bare wood, “and far less comfortable seating.”
AJ blows a kiss at his couch. “But we hope the room will be
equally friendly.”
“Who's we?” Emily asks.
“So far, Abigail, Cameron, Jessica, and me. The three of
them are doing ‘The Raven,' and they're now up to nine
stanzas, so you won't want to miss it. And I'll be reading
something especially tasty, of course.” Sydney folds the
flyer in half and fans herself. Then she gets serious again.
“Look, none of us have ever read outside this room, and
we're all fairly terrified, so come cheer us on. Please.”
Then she looks right at AJ. “If you think you might
perform, and need something like, say, a guitar, you should
bring that along.” She steps off the stage.
“I'm going to pass,” he says. “But I'll be there in the front
row, cheering for you guys.” AJ plants himself on the stool,
resting one foot on a rung and the other on the floor. It
reminds me of that day we were down here together, when
he told me all about the rules of Poet's Corner and then left
me alone to read its walls.
He's only wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but he's so
adorable right now. I want to leap up there and plant kisses
all over his face. That'd be one way to tell the rest of them, I
guess.
“Okay, take out your notebooks or whatever you write
in,” AJ says. Sydney holds a jumbo-size plastic bag of
wrappers and napkins in the air. I had no idea she had so
many poems. It's hard to believe she can zip that thing
closed.
“Ideally, everyone should read tonight, but if you don't
want to, that's okay,” he continues.
Caroline crosses her legs at the ankle and reclines into
the couch like she's settling in for the night.
“You're not reading?” She shakes her head. “Why not?” I
whisper, and she makes a face. “I should force you up on
that stage like you forced me.”
“Pfft. I'd like to see you try.”
“Since Sam's new, I'll explain how it works,” AJ says.
“One of the other members will join you on stage and
randomly pick one of your poems. You read it to the group. If
you don't want to read it, ask for another one or just pass.
It's not a requirement to read or anything, but this is a longstanding
tradition, started by the original founders of Poet's
Corner.” He shrugs. “As far as I can tell, it's some twisted
trust exercise designed to humiliate us in front of each
other.”
Everyone laughs. AJ looks at me. “Be glad you didn't find
us sooner, Sam. If you'd heard the ridiculous song I had to
play last time, you wouldn't have stuck around.”
That's impossible.
“Okay, who's up first?” He jumps off stage. “Cameron,
you read. Abigail, you choose.”
I reach for my yellow notebook. The blue poems are my
favorites, but the yellow ones are the safest.
Cameron hands Abigail a three-ring binder, and she picks
a page from the back. As it turns out, this poem isn't about
his parents' divorce. It's about a girl. He's reading so quietly
we all have to strain to hear him, but as he describes her
long black hair, I think I understand why. I'm pretty sure this
poem is about Jessica. They have been working on ‘The
Raven' together. Maybe AJ and I aren't the only secret down
here. Cameron's face is still bright red as he picks a poem
for Abigail.
She takes one look at his pick and lets out a whoop. “Yes!
Easy.” She launches in, reading a totally innocuous little
rhyme about the sunset. Lucky.
Abigail picks for Emily. She doesn't show any emotion
when she sees what she has to read. And for the first few
lines, she manages to keep it together through a poem
that's basically about all the things her mom might not be
around to see. But after she reads a verse about our high
school graduation, she stops. “I'm sorry,” she says. “I can't
do this tonight. Who's next?”
In a matter of seconds, Jessica is bounding up onto the
stage, long black braids trailing behind her like ribbons on a
kite, just like Cameron described them.
She hands Emily a bright purple book with a black rubber
band around it, and Emily picks a page and hurries back to
her seat. Jessica reads a short piece about her math
teacher's horrible breath and gives us a much needed mood
change.
Chelsea reads next. We're nearing the end of the line and
I'm starting to get nervous about my turn. I can feel myself
tuning out the voices on the stage and giving the ones in
my head far more attention than they deserve.
They could pick anything. I have no control.
The voices are getting louder, closing in, and my palms
are starting to sweat. I need to go. I need to get it over with.
But when Chelsea finishes, she immediately points at
Sydney, calling her up to the stage.
At least it's Sydney.
Chelsea reaches into the plastic bag and pulls out a piece
of pink cardboard. She starts to hand it to her, but Sydney
won't take it. “Nope. Pick another one, please.”
“Syd.”
“Another one, please.” Sydney can't stand still. I've never
seen her flustered. “Read it to yourself,” she says, “but then
pick again, please. That Taco Bell one is really funny.”
Chelsea is quiet as she reads it. Then she leans over and
whispers in Sydney's ear.
Sydney considers her for a long time before she finally
steps off the stage and collapses into the couch.
Chelsea holds the piece of pink cardboard in both hands.
“I've been granted permission to read this lovely poem,”
Chelsea says. “It's untitled. And I'm going to go out on a
limb here and say it was penned in a doughnut shop.”
Sydney's face is buried in the couch cushions in front of
her, but she nods dramatically.
I'm not allowed to want you,
And you're not allowed to want me.
So I'll just wait here patiently,
Hoping you'll break the rules.
Whoa. I'm dying to know who she's referring to. Someone
older? A teacher?
Everyone's clapping and looking over at Sydney, but
she's facedown on the couch now, underneath one of the
throw pillows. “Someone go next,” she yells. “Quickly.”
“I'll go,” I say, and I step up on the stage, handing
Chelsea my yellow notebook as I perch myself on the stool.
She feeds her finger into a random page near the back and
hands it to me.
I read the first few lines to myself.
This is bad.
I read the whole thing through in my head two more
times. There's a whole lot of crazy in here, but Caroline is
probably the only one who will really understand it anyway.
After all, I wrote it for her.
“This is untitled, and, I don't know, it's totally random.” I
stop short of saying it sucks because I don't feel like being
pelted with paper tonight. “I wrote it in my room after I said
good-bye to a friend of mine.” I find Caroline in the crowd
and smile at her.
I like it when you're here.
Everything is quiet.
Peaceful.
So silent, I almost feel sane.
You take my mind off my mind.
Stay.
Just one more page.
Please?
Caroline stands and starts clapping hard, and cheering
way too loudly, and looking so proud of me, I want to burst. I
take a bow, feeling a little proud of myself, too.
I did it. Now they kind-of-sort-of know about the crazy.
Suddenly AJ's on stage next to me, handing me his
clipboard, and if he's weirded out by my poem, he's doing a
great job hiding it. While he swings his guitar over his
shoulder and adjusts it in place, I thumb through his songs
and grab hold of a page near the top.
I pull it from the stack and hand it to him. “You can sit,”
he says with a cocky grin. “I'll play this no matter what it is.”
I step off the stage, taking his clipboard with me. He's
already plucking at strings, so I sit down on his orange
couch instead of returning to my spot next to Caroline.
“Shit,” he says, getting his first look at the song he
committed to sing. Then he looks right at me. His cheeks
are crimson and he's fidgeting with the paper. I've never
seen him so uncomfortable, not in Poet's Corner at least.
I watch him, growing even more confused when he
removes his guitar and returns it to the stand. He walks
right to the front of the stage, past the stool he always sits
on when he plays, and roots his feet in place.
“This isn't a song. It's a poem.” He jumps up and down a
few times, shaking his arms out by his sides. “How do you
guys do this? I feel totally naked up here without my guitar.”
We all laugh as he shuffles into position, feet rooted again,
and blows out a loud breath. “Okay, here we go.”
He looks right at me. “This is called ‘Wondering.' I wrote
this in my room a while ago.” His eyes never leave mine.
After you left
I stared at the driveway
Feeling its emptiness
Wondering if you'd return.
After you left
I thought about your questions
Wishing I hadn't been so blunt
Wondering if I scared you away.
After you left
I remembered how you felt in my arms.
How you fit so perfectly there. Like my guitar.
Wondering if I should have kissed you when I had the chance.
After you left
I sat in my room
Remembering all the things you said, and
Wondering about all the things you didn't.
After you left
I sat in silence.
Missing you in a way I didn't quite understand.
Wondering if you'd ever come back.
He drops his arm. “And now you can all see why I write
songs and not poetry.”
Everyone's staring at him, questioning this poem, curious
about his subject, but his eyes are still locked on mine, and
that dimple of his is more pronounced than ever.
I nervously glance around the room and watch each of
them connect the dots. Chelsea's face lights up. Emily
waves her finger in the air, back and forth between AJ and
me. Sydney lets out a fake-sounding gasp.
AJ steps off the stage and sits next to me, wrapping his
hand around the back of my neck. “They know,” he
whispers in my ear.
“You think?” I laugh into his shoulder.
“Sorry. That was lame.”
“It wasn't lame; it was perfect.”
“You're not angry, are you?”
“Of course not.” I give him a quick kiss, and we're
surrounded by the sounds of whistles and woots.
Then it gets awkward. Everyone starts shuffling around,
gathering bags and notebooks, heading for the door.
“Wait.” AJ stands and addresses the room. “Did everyone
read?”
“Everyone but Caroline,” I say, gesturing toward her. But
I'm not sure AJ hears me. He's already lifting his key out
from under his shirt and heading to the back to unlock the
bolt. She shakes her head, silently telling me it's okay. She
didn't plan to read anyway.
All nine of us quietly climb the stairs, cross the stage,
and file out the theater door. Everyone says their good-byes
and heads off in groups in separate directions, but AJ and I
hang back.
I wrap my arms around his neck and look up at him,
feeling euphoric. Buoyant. Like we're back in the pool,
floating, kissing, talking, laughing, just us, alone, together.
We're no longer a secret. It feels incredible.
“Do you want a ride home?” I ask, winding my fingers
into his hair. “You could watch me pull out of your driveway
and wonder if I'm devising a plan to sneak into your
bedroom.”
“Would you be?” He brings his hands to my waist.
“Absolutely,” I say. I'm not sure where all this confidence
is coming from, but it feels right.
“Then, yes.” He unzips my swim parka all the way to the
bottom this time, and when he wraps his arms around my
back, he pulls me into him, harder than he did before. He
kisses me harder, too, and I tighten my grip on the back of
his neck, thinking about how much I want this kiss to go on
and on. I can't imagine driving him home and saying good
night.
“You know what?” I whisper. My voice is shaking, and it's
not from the cold. “I think we forgot to turn the lamps off.”
“Did we?” he asks between kisses.
“Yeah.”
“Hmm. I didn't forget,” he says, and I can feel him
smiling.
I smile back. “Neither did I.”
As much as I've thought about sex, I've always had pretty
low expectations about my first time. I know it will be
awkward and there will be that whole struggling-with-thecondom
moment, and when it's all over, we'll get dressed
side by side and won't have a clue what to say to each
other. I've pictured my first time as something I'll have to do
to get it over with.
So far, this is nothing like that.
AJ kisses my forehead. “Stop thinking,” he whispers.
“I'm not.” But of course I am. I'm always thinking.
“Yes, you are. Your forehead is all crunched up.” He
kisses my forehead again and I feel the muscles relax. “We
don't have to do this, Sam.”
We're lying on the orange couch with a blanket beneath
us, our clothes in a haphazard pile on the floor. He's already
passed that condom thing with flying colors. I want to do
this. We're practically already doing this.
“It's okay. I'm just really nervous.”
“I know,” he says. “Me too.”
“You?” I stare at him in disbelief. “Why are you nervous?
You've done this before.”
“Never with you.”
I take his face in my hands and kiss him, closing my
eyes, letting his touch clear my mind, following his lead. I
force myself to think about nothing but him, to concentrate
on what he's doing, and after a while it becomes easier to
let go.
His kisses trail down my collarbone, over my chest,
across my stomach, each one sending chills through my
entire body. When he finally brings his mouth back to mine, I
kiss him, trying to lose myself the same way I did in the pool
that night. Our hips are pressed together, and I can't believe
how incredible it feels to be this close to him.
I didn't expect so much talking. But he checks in a lot,
and I like how the sound of his voice keeps me present,
bringing me back to him if I start to drift away.
“Are you okay?” he asks.
I slide my thumb over his bottom lip. “Yeah. I'm a lot
better than okay.”
“I don't want to hurt you.”
“You're not. You're amazing.”
“I'm not sure about you, but I think I like ‘whatever this
is.'”
I smile. “Me too.” He interlaces his fingers with mine, and
I'm surprised that such a simple thing can make me feel
even more connected to him.
Afterward, we lie there for a long time, face to face,
talking and laughing and wondering if we're the first ones to
lock ourselves inside the room this way.
“I don't know,” I say jokingly as I play with his fingers. “I
think you've dramatically overstepped your role as
keymaster.”
“I blame the couch,” he says. “I told you it was
inspirational.”
That cracks me up. “I don't think I'll ever be able to look
at it the same way again.”
“Yeah,” he says, crinkling his nose. “They probably
wouldn't want it back in the prop room now.”
“No,” I say, laughing harder. “I can't imagine they
would.”
I kiss him, feeling completely alive and totally normal—
saner than I've ever felt before—and now I can't wait to
walk through the halls with AJ, holding his hand, kissing him
good-bye between classes. I want to know him. Really know
him. And I want him to know me the same way.
The few lamps we left on softly illuminate the walls, and I
think about all the paper around us, all this love and pain
and fear and hope. We're surrounded by words. Nothing
about this moment could be more perfect, because I'm
absolutely in love with this room and the people in it, on the
wall and otherwise. And with this one boy in particular.
I still have no idea where Caroline eats lunch. I asked her
once and she said, “Places,” and when I asked her if she
eats alone she said, “Sometimes.” So I don't expect to see
her in the cafeteria today, but I stop at the door and scan
the entire room anyway.
I haven't been able to find her, not even at her locker this
morning, but I'm still buzzing over what happened with AJ
last night, and I can barely stand to keep it to myself
another second. I have to tell Caroline first. I wouldn't have
known him or any of the Poets if it weren't for her.
Where is she?
The Eights are already sitting at our usual table, Alexis
and Kaitlyn on one side, Olivia and Hailey on the other.
Olivia moves over to make room for me at the end of the
bench.
“Dieting?” she asks as I slide in next to her. I'm confused
until she points to the empty spot in front of me. “Where's
your lunch?”
“I'm not very hungry,” I say, but that's not entirely true.
I'm too excited and nervous and elated, too everything to
eat right now.
“So, what are we doing tonight?” Olivia asks. “I haven't
heard about any parties or anything.”
“I know. It's too quiet,” Kaitlyn says. She takes a sip of
her soda.
“Hey, I have an idea.” Alexis rests her elbows on the
table and looks at each of us. “My parents are going out.
Come over to my house. You guys haven't all spent the
night in ages.” I catch Hailey raise her eyebrows as she
takes a big bite of salad.
“I'm in,” Olivia says. Kaitlyn follows her with a “Ditto,”
and Hailey says, “Sure, why not?” Then there's silence.
They're all looking at me.
I wasn't expecting to find a perfect opening quite so
quickly, but here it is. I dig my fingernails into the back of
my neck three times and take a deep breath. “I can't
tonight. I have other plans.”
Alexis doesn't even try to hide the surprise in her voice.
“Really? Hot date?” she asks jokingly as she sips from her
bottled water.
“Actually…yes.”
Now I have their full attention. Kaitlyn pushes her soda
away, Olivia returns her sandwich to her plate, and Hailey's
jaw drops, along with her chip bag.
“With?” Alexis's eyes are wide as she asks.
I run my thumbs along the edge of the bench three
times. “AJ Olsen.”
Kaitlyn starts laughing, and at the same time Alexis asks,
“Who?” Everyone else looks at her and nods like they're
wondering the same thing.
“Wait,” Olivia says. “I know him. He's in my English
class.” She looks at me. “I mean, I don't know him or
anything. He never says much. But I know who he is.”
“You're serious?” Kaitlyn looks at me. She's still laughing.
“You're going out with Andrew Olsen? You're k-k-k-kidding.”
She slaps her hand on the table, cracking up at her own
joke. “No w-w-w-way.” She looks around the table, but I keep
my eyes fixed on her. My hands ball up into fists by my
sides.
“You guys remember Andrew. From elementary school.”
When they shake their heads, she sings that fucking Chia
Pet jingle again, and then elbows Alexis. “You remember
that kid, don't you? He stuttered so badly he couldn't even
say his own name.”
“Kaitlyn. Stop. Now.” Alexis says it like she's scolding her.
I've never heard her speak to Kaitlyn that way. I've never
heard anyone speak to Kaitlyn that way.
I wish I'd been the one to call her out, but I'm too
stunned to say anything. Still, I have to speak. It's my job to
defend him. I can't just sit here and let her mock him. “I-I…”
I choke on my words.
“See? It's contagious.” Kaitlyn starts cracking up again
but stops when she realizes everyone's staring at her and
none of them are joining in. “Oh, lighten up. That was
funny.”
After a deep breath, I press my palms into the table and
lean forward, closing in on her. My voice is shaking. “We
were horrible to him, Kaitlyn. We teased him so much, he
switched schools.”
“Oh, so you're pity-dating him?”
I look at her soda. I consider throwing it at her.
“I am not pity-dating him,” I say, picturing AJ on stage in
Poet's Corner, guitar swung over his shoulder, singing some
line that makes my heart race and my whole body melt. I
think about what happened last night, the way he looked at
me before, during, and after. “I'm in love with him.”
I just blurted it out. I can't believe I did. I look around the
table, watching for reactions, but they don't come, not right
away at least. The four of them are dumbstruck.
“You're in love with him? Do you even know him?” Alexis
finally asks.
Olivia jumps in before I can answer. “Wait, does he have
anything to do with where you go during lunch?”
Everything gets quiet again, and I watch my friends
process Olivia's words, seeing their expressions change
before my eyes as they clue into the fact that this thing with
AJ tonight isn't simply a hot date or even a first date. It's
probably one of many. And that I might have been serious
when I said that thing I just said.
“We've been hanging out together for a few months now.
First as friends and more recently as, well, more than that.”
They all look at each other, but none of them will look at
me.
“Well, this explains a lot,” Alexis finally says. “We've all
been talking about how you seem so different lately. Right?”
She looks around the table, addressing them individually.
Kaitlyn nods in agreement. Olivia, too. Hailey stares at her
food. “You've been acting like a totally different person.”
Hmm. Or maybe it's that I'm not acting.
Alexis reaches across the table and rests her hand on
mine. “You've changed, Samantha. And I think I speak for all
of us when I say that it's not for the better, sweetie.”
Not for the better? How could they not see that I'm a
better person? I told Shrink-Sue I felt healthier, more in
control of my emotions than I ever have. I'm no longer a
slave to their words and actions, and that means there's
something wrong with me.
“We don't feel like we even know you anymore,” Olivia
adds.
“You're right,” I say quietly. “You guys did know me, but I
don't think you do anymore. Not really.” I look around the
table as I talk, realizing, maybe for the first time, that I don't
know much about them either.
The words are right on the tip of my tongue, and I start to
tell them the truth: I need to get some distance from them.
But then I take one look at Hailey's face and think about
what she said in the bathroom that day, about how she
needed me and she didn't know what she'd do if I left like
Sarah did. I can't say it. Not today.
I look right at Kaitlyn. “You owe AJ an apology.”
“For what? Something I said when I was in fourth grade?
“No,” I say as I stand. “For something you said five
minutes ago.”
That cafeteria door seems like it's miles away, but I throw
my shoulders back and march toward it, holding my head a
little higher than it was when I walked in here.
I walk quickly to my locker, glad to be alone in the corridors
and back in the fresh air. I'm not sure what made me head
this direction, I was sort of on autopilot, but it turns out to
be the right call.
As I turn the corner, I let out a relieved sigh when I see
Caroline working her combination lock with one hand and
holding her backpack strap in the other.
“There you are! I've been looking for you all day.” I rest
my shoulder against a neighboring locker and come in close,
keeping my voice low. “I have so much to tell you.”
She continues loading books into her backpack, and I
keep talking.
“I told the Eights about AJ, and Kaitlyn made an insanely
cruel comment I can't even repeat, but I totally stood up for
him.” I shake my hands out by my sides. I'm all jittery.
Caroline zips her backpack and hoists it over her
shoulder, and when she turns in my direction, I can see her
T-shirt: YES, IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT ME.
“I know,” she says. “I was there. You were brilliant.”
“What do you mean, you were there?” She couldn't have
been. I didn't see her anywhere. I looked. “Where were
you?”
She rests her hand on one side of my face. “Close
enough to hear everything.” Then she steps away and tugs
on her flannel shirtsleeve, looking at her beat-up watch. “I
have to go now.”
“Go where? The bell doesn't ring for another twenty
minutes.” She stares at me with the strangest expression on
her face. “Wait, are you angry because I didn't tell them
about you? I meant to. I will. I promise.”
“No, I'm not mad. And please, don't tell them about me.
Ever.” She leans in closer. “But you should tell AJ.”
What?
My phone chirps and I pull it out of my back pocket and
read the message.
how'd it go?
“Go ahead,” she says. “Answer him.” Caroline gestures
with her chin to the phone. How did she know it was AJ? I
give her a funny look and type back:
really good. where are you?
I press SEND. And when I look up, Caroline's gone.
“Caroline?” I call out, but there's no response.
I run to the edge of the locker bank and look down the
corridor. Lunch is far from over, but it's starting to get a little
more crowded out here. I walk down the path that leads to
the student parking lot, and then double back to the one
that leads to the front entrance. I don't see her anywhere.
My phone chirps again.
downstairs practicing
It looks like he's typing another message, so I don't reply
right away.
playing at open mic tonight
I smile at the screen and type:
!!!
I take another spin around campus, still looking for
Caroline, and then start heading back toward my locker,
typing as I go. I think about what I said to my friends today.
What I blurted.
lots to tell you :)
The first bell rings and the halls become more crowded.
At my locker, I dial my combination and lift the latch, and
then I peek at the far end of the row, hoping to see Caroline.
I'm gathering my books for class when I feel hands
sliding over my hips. “Hey,” AJ says. My first instinct is to
check our surroundings to be sure we're alone, but then I
realize I don't have to do that anymore. I recline into his
chest, pull his arms even tighter around my waist, and kiss
him, knowing that people might be walking by and watching
us, but not caring at all.
“I take it you told your friends about us?” he asks when
we finally pull away. He's wearing a ski cap pushed back on
his head, and his hair is poking out underneath. He looks
adorable.
“The Eights know. And everyone else…” I crane my neck
to see what's happening behind us. People are slowing their
steps as they pass, and whispering to each other. “I'm
guessing they'll know by the time the final bell rings.”
“Wow. That's an amazing picture of you,” he says,
bringing my attention back to my locker.
“Thanks.” I settle into his shoulder, watching his
expression change as he scans over everything. He smiles
when he reads the little pink Post-it. His eyes shine when he
sees the picture of Cassidy and me, taken the day I broke
her butterfly record. He's more straight-faced when he looks
over photos of me and the rest of the Eights.
“Wow, you've been to a lot of concerts,” he says.
After today, I'm pretty sure my collection won't be
expanding.
“Is that one of my guitar picks?” he asks.
“Maybe.” I smile.
“Robber.”
I turn to face him and hook my fingers in the front belt
loops of his jeans. “Hey, you didn't happen to see Caroline
on your way over here, did you?” I gesture toward her
locker. “I just had the strangest conversation with her.”
“Caroline?”
“Yeah. It was weird. First she said she heard my
discussion with my friends, but that's impossible. She was
nowhere in sight. And then she said she had to go. And now
I can't find her anywhere. Did she seem upset last night?” I
ask.
AJ's expression morphs from confusion to concern.
“What?”
“She was the only one who didn't read, but she never
does. She didn't seem bothered by it or anything.”
The bell rings. AJ doesn't move away from me. There's no
one around, but I lower my voice anyway. “I came clean to
the Eights. I thought that's what she wanted. She's the one
who said I needed ‘new friends' and introduced me to all of
you. She's the one who brought me down to Poet's Corner in
the first place.”
I think about all the times Caroline listened to me read
my poems and gave me words that she thought might help
AJ see me in a different light, like my own personal Cyrano
de Bergerac.
“Sam?”
“Yeah?”
“Who's Caroline?”
“Caroline.” I say it with a laugh, but he doesn't join me.
“Caroline. Caroline…” It takes me a second to find her last
name. I haven't thought about it since the first day of
school. “Caroline Madsen.”
His eyes grow wider and I watch the color totally drain
from his face. “What did you say?” I feel the tug on my
fingers as he starts to step away from me, and I release his
belt loops, letting my hands fall to my sides.
“I said, ‘Caroline Madsen.' As in, our friend Caroline. AJ,
what's wrong?”
“Wait. Did you just say that Caroline brought you
downstairs?” He doesn't stutter, but his voice shakes and it
scares me.
“Of course,” I say, trying to understand why he's asking.
“She was with me that first day, remember?” I've thought
about it a million times. I can picture it like it was yesterday.
“You weren't going to let me stay, but then Caroline
grabbed my arm and you changed your mind.”
He stares at me for the longest time.
“She's the reason you let me stay,” I repeat. But I can tell
by the look on his face that maybe I'm wrong, so I add,
“Wasn't she?”
“No.” His voice is so faint. He takes a real step backward
this time.
Now I'm frightened, and I don't know why, but I know I'm
right to be. My heart starts racing and I want to get out of
here, bound for a dark, quiet room where I can catch my
breath and think, but I can't leave without hearing whatever
it is AJ's trying to tell me.
He takes his cap off and combs his fingers through his
hair. “Sam, she wasn't the reason I let you into Poet's Corner
that first day.”
Yes she was.
“The first time you came downstairs, you were alone. I let
you stay that day because you said you thought it might
change your life, and I liked that.”
I start to tell him that I didn't choose those words,
Caroline did. But I keep my mouth shut because I have a
feeling that isn't the right thing to say. I squeeze my eyes
closed and cover my face.
“No,” I say, shaking my head hard. “She brought me
there.” I open my eyes again and lock them on his. “How
else would I have found that room?”
His lips are pressed into a tight line. Then he says, “I
have no idea.”
“I do. I found it because she brought me there.” I say it
with more force than I intended to.
He stares at the ground for a long time, and finally, he
looks at me again. “Do you know who Caroline Madsen is?”
“Of course I do.”
She's my friend. She might be my best friend.
“Sam.” I hear a strange hitch in his voice when he says
my name. “Caroline Madsen committed suicide…in 2007.”
I laugh. “Shut up,” I say, but he's doesn't look like he's
joking. “So, what? You're saying I've been talking to a
ghost?” But as soon as the words leave my mouth, I know
deep in my gut that's not right.
Now he's taking even larger steps, backing away even
faster, and his fingers are impossible to miss, flicking
against the stitching on his jeans. “I should…I have to…get
to class,” he says, and he's gone before I have a chance to
tell him he's wrong. He has to be.
She was just here ten minutes ago.
Wasn't she?
I was standing here talking to her.
Wasn't I?
I slam my locker door and take off running for the parking
lot. It takes two hands to start the car, one to bring the key
to the ignition, and the other to hold it steady. The engine
roars to life and I peel into the street, bound for the only
place it occurs to me to go.
In the lobby, I press the button for the elevator three times,
and when nothing happens, I press it again, three more
times. I slam my hand against the door, and the bell dings
as the doors slide open. I press 7 three times.
I burst through the door and Colleen jumps out of her
chair. “Sam?”
“I need to see Sue.” My voice doesn't even sound like
mine, and my legs feel wobbly underneath me. I walk
straight for her office and open the door. Colleen is right
behind me. “Where is she?” I yell with my fingertips pressed
into my temples.
Colleen grabs my arms, pushes me into the chair, and
crouches down in front of me. She's trying to pull my hands
away from my face, but I won't let her. I'm crying hard and
only half listening to what she's saying, but I hear “hospital”
and “won't be back today” and “call her.” Then “wait” and
“water” and “don't move.”
When Colleen's gone, I slide my hands down to my
cheeks and look around the room. Two days ago, I sat here
and told Sue I was better. I was better. I know I was. But
then I remember Alexis's words, “You've changed…and it's
not for the better, sweetie.”
What's happening to me?
I stand up fast and hurry for the door, into the elevator,
back into my car. There's this spot on the top of the hill that
looks down on the valley; it's where everyone goes to park
and make out, and at this time of day, it'll be deserted.
My hands are tight on the wheel as I wind around the
sharp twists and turns, climbing until the road dead-ends. I
park next to the big oak tree and cut the engine.
AJ is wrong; he has to be. Caroline was there, at every
reading, during every lunch hour. She sat next to me. She
met me in the theater. She read my earliest poems, told me
I was good. She taught me how to let go and write what I
felt, and gave me words when I couldn't find them myself.
She helped me take the stage. She was one of the—how did
I jokingly refer to it the other day—the Poetic Nine?
Wasn't she?
I pull my phone from the cup holder and find the most
recent group text, the one AJ sent last night to call the
Poet's Corner meeting. His name is right at the top. Next to
it: To Sam and six more…
I know her number won't be here, but I tap the word
“more” to help me take inventory. Everyone is a jumble of
unidentified phone numbers, and I assign each one a name
as I count them. AJ. Cameron. Chelsea. Emily. Jessica.
Abigail. Sydney.
Seven total.
“Technology is a trap,” Caroline had said, and I believed
her.
She never called me. She never texted me. I thought it
was odd, but I never questioned it.
My stomach rolls over, and my fingers are shaking so
violently, I'm having a hard time holding the phone in my
hands.
I open the browser and type in “Caroline Madsen 2007”
and within seconds, the tiny screen is filled with links that
lead to her story. Headline after headline reading, TEEN'S
DEATH RULED A SUICIDE; BULLYING TO BLAME FOR LOCAL TEEN'S SUICIDE?;
LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DEVASTATED BY SUICIDE. The last one contains a
picture, so I click through to the full story.
“Oh, my God,” I whisper. I remember reading this article,
not last summer, but the summer before.
Cassidy had just come back from Southern California to
spend the break with her dad. He bought a new house, and
she was thrilled to finally have her own room when she
came to visit. She'd heard a rumor that a girl had killed
herself in the house years ago, and she asked me if I'd
heard about it. I hadn't.
Later that week, I went home with her after swim
practice and she gave me a tour. We sat in Cassidy's new
room, did a quick Internet search for local teen suicides, and
didn't find much beyond this one case. We pulled up a
bunch of articles, including this one.
Now, I'm looking at the story again, over a year later, this
time on my phone. I scan it quickly for the salient points and
latch on to words and phrases like “suicide” and “target of
bullying” and “history of depression,” but the tears are
welling up in my eyes.
Her parents were at a Christmas party, only a few houses
away. While they were gone, Caroline Madsen threw back a
bottle of sleeping pills and never woke up. Her mom and
dad didn't realize what happened until the following
morning. By the time I get to the quote from her mom,
talking about her daughter's witty sense of humor and how
she loved to write poetry, the words are so blurry, I can't
read any more.
Scrolling down to the photo, I find a girl who looks exactly
like the Caroline I know. Hair slightly disheveled. No
makeup. She's wearing a flannel, unbuttoned, over a T-shirt.
I zoom in so I can read it: IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND, YOU
WOULDN'T BE SMILING.
I run my finger across the screen, laughing at the shirt
and fighting back tears at the same time. I remember sitting
in Cassidy's room, looking at this photo, skimming this
article. We closed the browser, sad for this girl we never
knew, and I don't remember giving it another thought.
Now, everything starts to fall into place.
Caroline and I sat together in the theater one day, me
complaining about my friends, her telling me I needed new
ones. I confided in her about my OCD and she told me about
her struggles with depression.
But Caroline never read on stage. She came to my house,
but she always left before anyone got home. We wrote
together in the theater, just the two of us, alone in the dark.
She never minded being my secret.
She never led me to Poet's Corner.
“She's not real.” The words squeak out.
The tears are falling freely now, and I toss my phone hard
on the passenger seat and it bounces onto the floor. I throw
open the door, walk to the edge of the cliff, and stand there,
looking out over the town. It's overcast and chilly, but the
bite in the early December air feels good in my lungs.
From up here, I can see my house. AJ's is on the other
side of town and harder to find, but I spot the dense cluster
of trees that distinguish his neighborhood. Alexis's house is
on a hill on the opposite side of the canyon, massive and
easy to see. The swim club is easy to find too, and from
there, I trace the route I've driven and walked plenty of
times—up the hill, round the hairpin turn, straight to the top,
until I see Cassidy's dad's house.
Caroline lived there. She died there.
“Depression,” she'd told me the first time we sat
together in the dark theater. “Sometimes it feels like it's
getting worse, not better.”
I walk over to the big oak tree and throw up in the dirt.
And then I sit on the edge of the cliff, my knees to my chest,
digging my nails into the back of my neck and scratching
hard. I feel the sting on my skin, but I keep going, not
bothering to wipe the tears as they stream down my cheeks,
feeling empty and cold, mourning the loss of my best friend
like it's recent and raw, as if she killed herself this afternoon
and not eight years ago. I rock back and forth, scratching
harder, crying and muttering “Caroline” under my breath,
over and over again.
Like the crazy person I now know I am.
Once the sun went down, the temperature started
dropping fast. I'm not sure how long I've been out here, but
my chest feels numb, my eyes are puffy, my face is sore,
and there's dirt caked under my fingernails.
I pull myself up off the ground and collapse in the driver's
seat. The car door has been open for hours, the dome light
on the entire time, so I give the ignition a quick turn to be
sure I didn't kill the battery. The engine starts right up. I
crank the heat.
My phone is on the floor next to the console. Texts and
missed-call messages fill the screen, and I scroll down, past
countless pleas from my mom to call her right away. There
are three missed calls from Shrink-Sue, the last one only
twenty minutes ago.
I hit the call-back button and Sue picks up on the first
ring. The tears start falling again when I hear her voice, and
I squeak out a faint, “It's me.”
“Where are you?” she asks, panic in her voice like I've
never heard. I tell her about the hill and give her the cross
streets, and she tells me not to move, that she's on her way.
I hang up the phone and stare at the clock on the
dashboard. It's 7:12.
Open mic.
I'm supposed to be on my way to the city right now. I'm
supposed to be watching my boyfriend play guitar on a real
stage, and Caroline's supposed to be next to me, cheering
him on. Instead, I'm here in the dark, all cried out, waiting to
be rescued. I hope AJ won't tell the Poets; I'll never be able
to face them again.
I'll never be able to face him again.
I picture the look on his face when he told me about
Caroline. What a sharp contrast it was from the expression
he wore just minutes earlier, as he stood there, admiring
that photo of me on the diving block. The me he thought he
knew, next to the real me he was forced to see for the first
time. Once he saw who I really am, he couldn't get away
fast enough.
I never wanted him to find out. And now he's gone.
Headlights shine into the back window, and minutes
later, Shrink-Sue's guiding me into her shiny black Benz and
buckling the seat belt around me. “Your parents are on their
way to get your car,” I hear her say.
As Sue winds her way down the hill, I stare out the
window, wondering where we're going and deciding I don't
care. I feel heat on my face. My butt is getting hot from the
seat warmer. I rest my forehead against the glass, close my
eyes, and don't open them again until we're stopped in a
driveway, waiting for a garage door to open.
Sue pulls in and cuts the engine. She comes around to
my side of the car and unbuckles the belt, helping me out as
if I'm elderly and infirm, and leads me inside the same way.
We arrive in a kitchen, and two girls stop what they're
doing. They're a few years younger than me and a lot
smaller; like Sue, tiny in every way. Same straight hair.
Same delicate features. They've grown up since they took
those photographs that sit on Sue's desk, but I recognize
them immediately.
“Sam,” she says gently, “these are my daughters, Beth
and Julia.”
Their expressions are full of concern, but I guess I
shouldn't expect anything else; I've been crying in the dirt
for the last five hours. And they're just staring, like they
aren't sure what to make of me, but that doesn't surprise
me either. Knowing Sue and her commitment to
“professional distance,” I'm pretty sure she's never brought
a patient into her house.
“Julia, would you get us some tea, please?”
Sue leads me out of the kitchen, past the living room,
and through a set of double doors. This must be Sue's home
office. It overlooks a perfectly manicured garden, set in a
circle with a fountain at the center. It's softly lit. Peaceful. I
walk to the glass door. “This sure beats the view of the
parking lot.”
“It's my favorite place.” She's standing right behind me.
“I sit right there,” she says, pointing over my shoulder to an
oversize metal chair with deep cushions and lots of throw
pillows. “That's where I think, or meditate, or work on
patient files. Unless it's raining, that's where you'll find me.”
We're both quiet for a long time. I can hear the sound of
the fountain through the glass. It's soothing.
“Are you still cold?” she asks.
I shake my head.
“Do you want to sit outside?” she asks.
I nod.
“Good.” She steps forward and twists the lever on the
French door, and it swings open. “Let's talk out there until
we can't take it.” She grabs two blankets from a basket on
the floor and wraps one around my shoulders. She tells me
to sit in her favorite chair.
Julia arrives holding a cast-iron teapot and two mugs. Sue
thanks her and arranges everything on the table in front of
us, pouring out a mug of steaming tea and handing it to me.
Sue settles into a spot on the couch, and Julia leaves,
closing the double doors behind her.
“You can talk whenever you're ready, Sam.”
I pull my knees to my chest and hold my mug in both
hands, staring down into it, breathing in steam and inhaling
the scents of flowers and citrus, thinking about everything
that's happened since I sat in Sue's office two days ago. The
P.M. Poet's Corner meeting. AJ and me alone downstairs.
Telling the Crazy Eights about him. Caroline saying good-bye
to me in her own way.
Caroline.
I'm surprised I have any tears left, but sure enough, they
start falling again. A tissue appears in front of me, as if by
magic, and I dab my eyes and blow my nose.
Shrinks and their tissues.
“What do you already know?” I ask.
“That doesn't matter. I don't know anything unless I hear
it from you.”
I understand her code. That means she's spoken with
Colleen. I think about the urgent calls and texts from my
mom, and wonder if she called AJ looking for me. If she
talked to him and he told her what happened today, Sue
must have a pretty clear picture.
“You asked me to make one new friend,” I say, staring
into my mug. “And I did. And I liked her. A lot. But as it turns
out, she's been dead for eight years, which, as you might
expect, can really hinder a friendship.” I thought sarcasm
would make me feel better, but it doesn't. I start crying
even harder.
Sue takes my cup out of my hands so I can pull myself
together. I wipe my eyes and blow my nose while Sue tops
off my mug. She trades my hot tea for a pile of snotty
tissues and doesn't seem to care.
Once I start talking, I can't stop. I've sworn to keep Poet's
Corner a secret, but I can't keep it from Sue anymore. I
describe that first day I ran into Caroline in the theater, how
she settled in next to me, made me laugh, told me that she
wanted to show me something that would change my whole
life.
“Tell me exactly what happened,” Sue says. “Start at the
beginning.”
“Caroline told me to meet her on the stage, next to the
piano.” I close my eyes and see the scene a bit differently,
like I'm watching it from a bird's-eye view. “I waited for her,
hiding on the other side of the curtain until I heard the
group pass by.”
“And then Caroline met you.”
“She told me to follow her, and I did. We went down this
narrow staircase, and through the gray-painted halls. She
told me where to turn, which doors to open.”
I picture the two of us rounding that final corner, just in
time to see the door at the far end swinging shut.
“What is this place?” I'd asked her when we were
standing in front of it. She ignored my question and pointed
to the doorknob.
“I'm going to be by your side the entire time, but this is
all up to you from here. You have to do all the talking.”
My eyes spring open.
It was me all along. I saw the doors in front of me closing.
That's how I knew where to go. I turned the knobs—she
never did. I saw the mop heads on the wall, swaying as if
they'd just been moved. I found the hidden seam, the dead
bolt.
I followed them.
“Caroline didn't bring me downstairs.” I can barely get
the words out.
Caroline didn't stand to the side and tell me to knock. I
did that on my own. I heard her say it was up to me from
that point on, but that wasn't exactly true. It was always up
to me.
“I saw them walk across the stage that first day.”
“See you Thursday,” someone had said.
“I came back when I knew they'd be there again. I waited
behind the curtain, by the piano, and then I followed them.
Oh, my God, Sue. I followed them down there.”
I tell her about the first time I visited the room in the
basement. “AJ was really cold to me,” I say, picturing the
way he stared me down until Caroline grabbed my arm in
solidarity. Only she didn't.
I set my mug on the table and wrap the blanket around
me tighter. Sue asks me what happened next, and I tell her
about the time Caroline came to my house and we hung out
in my room together. She told me AJ didn't hate me, but I'd
hurt him and he didn't know how to handle that. I suck in a
breath, realizing that conversation never actually happened
either. I knew what Kaitlyn and I had done. I didn't
remember it consciously, but I knew all along. I think about
the poem Caroline helped me write, and how I used her
words to ask him to forgive me. And he did. He let me stay.
They all let me stay.
I tell Sue about every interaction I had with Caroline and
the rest of the Poets, and how that room in the basement
calmed my mind. There, I learned how to write and let go
and speak up. I became one of them.
Now I'm crying hard again, because despite all the
incredible things that have happened over the last few
months, I can't stop thinking about the one thing that's
wrong with this whole picture.
“I made up a whole fucking person, Sue!” I yell through
tears. “What kind of twisted mind makes up a whole
person?”
“You didn't just make up a person, Sam. You made up a
unique and wonderful person who was all the things you
needed her to be. Funny and smart and kind—”
“And again, Sue. Not. Fucking. Real.”
“She was real to you.”
Was. Of all those words, that's the one that stings the
most. I miss her. Real or imaginary, I don't want her to be
gone.
“What's happening to me?” I ask. Sue scoots to the edge
of the couch and sets her tea on the table.
“This isn't what you want to hear, Sam, but the truth is, I
don't know. It might have to do with your medications, or
chemical changes taking place in your brain, or a
combination of the two. It could have nothing to do with any
of those things.” She's trying to keep her voice calm and
level, but I can tell she's concerned. A lot more concerned
than I want her to be. “What's happening to you isn't
consistent with OCD. Something else is going on, and I'm
not sure what it is yet, but we're going to figure it out
together, just like we always do.”
I pull the blanket over my head. I can't look at her. I don't
want to listen to her either, but I need the information she's
sharing in a way I can't ignore.
“Based on what you've told me tonight, I think Caroline
becomes real to you in moments of extreme anxiety.” The
sound of her voice is soothing me, and I feel a deep sense of
relief when she starts talking again. “You met her on the
first day of school. You were already highly anxious, but you
became even more troubled about something Alexis said,
and that might have sent your mind looking for…a new way
to cope.”
I pull the blanket off my head so I can see Sue's face.
“And it worked. So after that,” she continues, “Caroline
came around when you needed her to. After your fights with
the Eights. When you were nervous about following a group
of strangers down a dark, narrow staircase. When you had
to read on stage for the first time. She was there today,
after you told your friends about AJ, right?”
I mentally transport myself back to those moments, and
then to all the others Sue didn't mention. Whenever I was
upset about something and needed to write, Caroline would
be right there, waiting at her locker. We'd joke about it, like
it was a coincidence. Then we'd go to the theater together.
“Your mind found a solution—a pretty positive one, I
might add—and the more it worked, the more real she
became to you.” Sue reaches for her tea and takes a sip,
watching me over her mug, like she's giving me time to let
it all sink in.
“Has she been showing up a little less frequently?” she
asks.
Now that I think about it, she hasn't been at her locker in
the morning, not every day, like she used to be. I never see
her between classes.
“Over the past few weeks, I've really only seen her in
Poet's Corner.”
It fits Sue's theory. I'm always anxious about going down
there during lunch. I'm afraid the Crazy Eights are going to
follow me and find out about that place, and I'll be the one
who exposes the group and the room. It'll be my fault. I'm
always a wreck until that door bolts closed. Then I start to
relax.
“You read about a girl named Caroline over a year ago,
and you thought you forgot all about her, but she stuck
around in your subconscious. You gave her characteristics
you have a hard time expressing. And she became that
kind, caring voice you needed to hear.”
All this information is making me feel better in the way
concrete facts often do. That last bit even makes me feel a
little relieved.
Still, Sue's talking about this whole thing like it all makes
perfect sense, like it's perfectly logical, but it doesn't and
it's not. This whole thing is completely insane.
“You can go ahead and say it, Sue. I'm crazy.”
She's quiet for a full minute, staring into the fountain and
trying, I assume, to figure out how to deliver this news.
“Crazy,” she finally says, her eyes still fixed on the water.
“Do you know the dictionary's definition of ‘crazy'?” I shake
my head. “It means both ‘insane' and ‘a bit out of the
ordinary.' That's a pretty broad scope, don't you think?”
I nod.
“Crazy is such a subjective word. I'd never use it to label
anyone—certainly not you. Look, your brain functions
differently from other brains, Sam. And because of the way
your brain works, you got to know this wonderful person
named Caroline. No one else had that privilege.”
“Like your patient, Anthony…The guy who could hear
colors.”
“Exactly.”
But I was getting better. Feeling normal.
Two days ago, I wanted Sue to consider stepping down
the meds and cutting back my therapy. Now that I'm having
full conversations with imaginary people, I'm assuming the
opposite is true. More meds. More therapy sessions. No
more Caroline.
“We need to be sure Caroline's gone for good, right?” I
say, sad about the diagnosis, but proud to beat Sue to the
shrink-think.
“Do you want her to go away?”
“No.” Caroline felt as real to me as everyone else in
Poet's Corner. She's only been gone for a few hours, but I've
never missed anyone more. The idea of never seeing her
again makes my whole body feel hollow.
Tears start sliding down my cheeks again.
“Remember Wednesday, when you listed all the things
that made AJ so incredible?” Sue hands me another tissue.
She's giving me that look, the piercing one that makes me
feel like she can see right into my soul. “Do the same for
Caroline—not the girl you learned about today, but the girl
you've come to know over the last few months—your friend,
Caroline.”
My mind starts racing and I feel that same sensation I do
when I first step up on stage, my chest tightening, that
uncomfortable tingling in my fingertips. Maybe that's why I
close my eyes.
I begin counting, starting with my thumb. “She has this
energy about her—I can't explain it—but it's kind of
contagious. She listens to my poetry, even the really stupid
stuff I should never share with anyone, and she never
laughs at me. And she doesn't just listen to the words I
write, she hears what I'm really trying to say and helps me
figure out how to express it. She seems to know when I
need her.”
I open my eyes and bite my lip because, yeah, the
reason that one's true is now pretty obvious.
Sue brushes her fingers over her own eyelids, silently
telling me to close mine again.
I pick up where I left off, holding up my fifth finger. “She's
a little bit damaged, just like me. She doesn't give a shit
what people think of her. I love how she doesn't wear
makeup. I love her snarky T-shirts.” I feel a smile spread
across my face. “She always makes me laugh, even when
she isn't trying to.”
The tenth one pops to mind immediately, and I start to
say it like it's no big deal, but I find myself choking on my
words.
“That's nine,” Sue says.
Caroline told me to knock on that door. She never spoke
for me, but she gave me the words to say. When AJ kicked
me out of Poet's Corner, she told me to fight my way back
down there again. When I was terrified to read on stage, she
came up behind me, rested her hand on my shoulder, and
said, “Don't think. Just go.” And I did. She was always there.
And yet, she never was.
“She made me brave,” I say.
Sue reaches over and takes my hands, gripping them
hard in hers. It strikes me how dainty but strong they are.
“Good. Here's what you do now. You take those parts of
Caroline and honor the fact that they're part of you. You
start being kind to yourself, making decisions that are best
for you, not best for everyone else. You look around at the
people in your life, one by one, choosing to hold on to the
ones who make you stronger and better, and letting go of
the ones who don't. I think that's what Caroline wanted. She
didn't make you brave, Sam. You did that all on your own.”
We sit there for a long time. I drink more tea. I listen to
the water cycle through the fountain.
“She's not coming back, is she?” I ask.
“I don't think you need her anymore,” Sue says gently. “If
she shows up again, tell me, but don't panic. Let her do her
job. She seems pretty good at it.”
She's not coming back.
I keep thinking about Caroline and how she left today,
and that leads me to a memory of AJ and how he had to be
the one to tell me that my new best friend had been dead
for eight years.
I'm mortified. I didn't want him to find out. Not now.
Certainly not like this.
“I didn't want AJ to know about me,” I say.
Sue takes a sip of her tea. “Are you sure about that?”
“What do you mean?”
“Caroline could have left at any time, in a number of
ways. She could have told you exactly who she was in the
privacy of your room. She could have disappeared without
ever saying anything at all. But the way she left, the things
she said…”
“What's your point?”
“You say you didn't want AJ to know about you, but if you
think about it, a big part of you did.”
I didn't wake up feeling brave on Saturday, and I don't feel
brave on Sunday either. I feel sad and confused, scared and
lonely, missing Caroline more than ever, and wishing
everyone would just leave me alone.
Paige keeps knocking on my door to see if I want ice
cream, and I can hear Mom on the other side of the door,
telling her to give me my space. It's good advice. I wish
she'd take it herself, because she keeps checking on me,
asking me if I want to talk, and I keep telling her I'm fine
and sending her away.
While I was rocking in the dirt last Friday evening, AJ
came to my house looking for me. Instead, he found my
mom. He told her what I'd said about Caroline, and that he
was worried about me. And she politely thanked him, hid
her surprise that I'd never told him about my OCD, and
protected my secret like she always has. Then she sent him
away, asking him to leave me alone for a few days so I
could figure things out.
I'm sure he was relieved. Every time I think about that
look on his face when he first heard me say Caroline
Madsen's name, I want to be sick.
To distract myself, I've been going through my poems,
thinking about the ones Caroline helped me write. Not
always, but sometimes, there was that moment at the end,
when we finished a piece and read it aloud, and the words
were so perfect, so fitting, they gave me chills. I'd feel the
urge to hug her, but I never did, and now I wonder what
would have happened if I had. Would I have felt her the
same way I felt her hand on my shoulder? Or would she
have ghosted right through my arms as my body discovered
that my brain had been tricking me all along?
I pick up my pen and tap it against my notebook, but I
can't write a poem. Not now. I don't know what to say, not
even to a blank sheet of paper that no one else will ever
see. Besides, poetry isn't going to help me piece all these
emotions I'm feeling into a cohesive solution I can wrap my
brain around.
I'm scared of my mind's power. I'm angry with Caroline
for leaving. I'm confused about all her personality traits,
struggling to make sense of the ones I fabricated and the
ones that might have existed in a girl who committed
suicide in 2007.
I open my red notebook and label the left page “Caroline
Madsen.” I label the right page “My Caroline.” And for the
next two hours, I research everything I can find on the real
one, listing it on the left, and detailing everything I know to
be true about the one I created on the right.
When I'm done, I see the similarities, but I also spot
distinct differences. And I realize that Sue was right: I took a
face in a photo and gave her a lot of traits that deep down, I
wish I possessed.
I bury my face in my pillow to block out the sunlight. I cry
for a long time. And when I finally feel myself drifting off to
sleep, I don't fight it.
I hear a knock on my bedroom door. “Sam?” Mom says
quietly.
“I'm sleeping,” I yell.
“Sam, there's someone here to see you.”
I open my eyes and force myself to sit up. My room is
dark. My T-shirt is tangled around me, my hair is matted
against the side of my head, and I smell like sweat. My
notebook is still splayed open across my comforter, and I
slam it closed as Mom opens the door and steps inside.
“Please,” I say, pointing dramatically at my face. “Tell
him I don't want to see him right now.”
It's true, but still, my chest feels a whole lot lighter. I
knew he'd come over, even though my mom told him not to.
I don't want AJ to see me like this, but I'm dying for him to
wrap his arms around me and kiss my forehead and tell me
to stop thinking so hard. He'll tell me to talk to him, and I
will because all he has to do is say those words and my
mouth seems to kick into gear before my brain can stop it. I
start combing my fingers through my hair, hoping I can
force it to comply with gravity.
“It isn't AJ, honey. It's Hailey.”
“Hailey.” Her name hits me like a punch in the gut. I
haven't seen Hailey or any of the Eights since I left the
cafeteria last Friday, and none of them know what happened
after I did. I'd practically forgotten about our fight. My whole
face ignites with the thought, and I fall onto my bed and
bury my face in my pillow.
I can't deal with this right now.
“She looks pretty intent on coming upstairs,” Mom says
as she sits on the edge of my bed. “She even brought
flowers.”
“Flowers? Why? She didn't do anything wrong.”
Mom starts rubbing my back. “Let her come in, Sam.
Hear what she has to say. Who knows, maybe she'll cheer
you up.”
“I don't want to cheer up.” I want to see Caroline. I want
her to not be dead so I can not be crazy.
I can tell Mom's not letting up, so I give her a “fine,
whatever” as I climb out of bed. I stand in front of the fulllength
mirror, pulling myself together.
“Hailey has always been my favorite,” Mom says as she
leaves the room.
A few minutes later, Hailey walks in with her head bowed
low. “Hi, Samantha.” She hands me a bouquet of cheerylooking
flowers.
“Thanks. You didn't need to do this.” I bring the bouquet
to my nose. The scent reminds me of Sue's garden, and I'm
taken aback by the wave of sadness that passes over me
when I think about sitting out there, talking about Caroline
last Friday night.
I miss her.
“Are these from you? Or from all of you?”
Hailey understands what I'm really asking, and I know
the answer before she even says a word; I can tell by the
way she bites her bottom lip and shuffles her foot on the
carpet. She's not here as the group's representative.
“Just me.” She glances around my room. “I'm so sorry.
You stood up for me and I didn't do the same for you.
Twice.”
“It's okay.”
“Wow…It's been months since I was in your room. Why is
that?” she asks, changing the subject.
“I don't know,” I say, but it's not true. The last time she
was here, we were preparing for the Valentine's Day
fundraiser and my floor was covered with red roses and pink
ribbon and sappy love notes.
“I'd forgotten how cozy it is in here. And the paint is
really pretty.” She walks over to the collage on my wall, runs
her fingertip along the words THE CRAZY 8S, and studies the
photos. “Wow. Is this really us?” Hailey asks. “We were so
sweet and happy and…we look like we genuinely liked each
other.” She lets out a laugh. “I remember thinking I was the
luckiest person in the world to be part of this group. When
did we change?”
“I don't know. But I'm starting to think we can't change
back.”
There's a long pause. “Actually, I did stand up for you. It
was a little late, but I hope it still counts.”
“You did?”
She nods. “And then I chased after you.”
“What?” No. That welcome sense of relief pops like a
balloon. Now my mind is racing as I step through everything
that happened in the minutes after I left the Crazy Eights in
the cafeteria. I went straight to my locker. Caroline was
there. She touched my face and told me she'd heard
everything. We talked. When she disappeared, I followed
her. I yelled her name through the corridors.
Oh, God. Hailey saw me talking to…nobody. She knows.
“We all got in a huge fight after you left the cafeteria. I
told Kaitlyn she owed you an apology, but you know her.
Alexis sided with her, of course, even though she looked a
little unsure about it.”
What did you see?
“And Olivia…” Hailey rolls her eyes. “She could have
come with me to find you, but…well, she didn't.”
What. Did. You. See?
I try to think of a way to ask her without really asking.
“Why didn't you tell me this on Friday?” I ask, my voice
shaking.
Hailey plops down on my bed and leans back on her
hands. “I couldn't find you,” she says.
I sit next to her and let out a sigh of relief. “You
couldn't?”
“No. I went straight to your locker, but you weren't
there.”
“Huh,” I say.
“You're leaving us, aren't you?” She folds her legs
underneath her and sits up straight. “I wouldn't blame you if
you did. And you have a boyfriend now, so it would probably
happen anyway, but…”
“Hailey.” I hug her. She squeezes my shoulders so hard,
it's like she's being pulled underwater and I'm the only thing
she has to keep her afloat. “I don't know what I'm going to
do yet. But if I do leave, you can always come with me.”
She pulls away, shaking her head. “I'm not sure I could
do that.”
I know what she's thinking. Leaving the Eights changes
everything. No more lunches. No more concerts. No more
sleepovers or parties. We wouldn't be included in Kaitlyn's
grand plans for Junior Prom, or invited to stay at the hotel in
the city afterward. The rest of our high school experience
would be completely different from the one we expected.
Or worse, the remaining Eights would give us the same
treatment they gave Sarah. We'll be shunned in the halls.
They'll start rumors about us, just in case the rest of our
classmates consider feeling sorry for us or taking our side
instead of theirs.
“How can I help you at school tomorrow?” she asks.
It might be the nicest thing she's ever said to me, but I
honestly don't know how to answer her. I can't face the
Eights. I can't go to Poet's Corner. I'm too embarrassed to
talk to AJ right now, and my heart can't handle the idea of
going to my locker multiple times throughout the day,
looking for Caroline at every stop, knowing I won't see her
once. My eyes start to well up and I swallow a gulp of air.
“Actually, you can do two things.” I walk over to my desk
and grab my backpack. “You know my combo. Would you
get all my books out of my locker and meet me at yours
before first period tomorrow?”
“All your books?” she asks.
I nod. Hailey throws my backpack over her shoulder. “No
problem. What's the second favor?”
“Will you please start calling me Sam?”
I'm not sure I can get through the entire week without
accidentally running into any of the Eights or the Poets, but
since I couldn't talk my mom into homeschooling me for the
rest of the year, that's the plan for now.
I drive around the student lot a few times until I can park
on a three. Then I cut the engine and stare at the digital
clock, giving myself just enough time to make it to Hailey's
locker and then to class. When I arrive, Hailey hands me my
overstuffed backpack, and I hug her before I take off for first
period.
For the rest of the day, I take circuitous routes to each
class and arrive right as the bell rings. As soon as each class
ends, I bolt for the door and head straight for the nearest
bathroom. At break, I go to the library and eat a PowerBar in
the biography section (now I see what Olivia meant; this is
an excellent place to make out or otherwise go unseen). At
lunch, I head to the pool and swim laps, which turns out to
be the highlight of my day. I don't even wear a cap. And I
don't race. I swim freestyle in slow, precise strokes, up and
down the lane, blocking out all the thoughts, including lyrics
and poetry. I concentrate on the peaceful silence and savor
the smell of chlorine.
My hair is still damp as I'm heading to fifth period, so of
course, that's when I spot AJ walking toward me. My
stomach knots up as I duck into a row of lockers and lean
against the far wall, hiding my face in my hands like a little
kid, assuming, I suppose, that if I can't see him, he can't see
me either.
“Sam.”
Crap.
My hands fall to my sides as I look up at him. “Hi.”
“Hi.”
I can tell he has something to say and that he's nervous
about it, because in my peripheral vision, I can see his right
hand, thumb and forefinger pressed together, strumming
lightly on the side of his jeans.
“Are you okay?” he asks.
I shake my head. Then I fix my gaze on his shoes and
bite the inside of my lip three times, hard.
AJ keeps his distance, but I wish he wouldn't. I want to
tell him everything. And then I want him to slip his hands
around my back and wrap me in his arms like he did on
campus last Thursday night. I visualize his mouth on mine,
wordlessly telling me that it's all okay and that he still wants
me, broken brain and all. But it's not fair to expect that from
him. What's he going to do, tell me he thinks it's kind of
cute that I fabricated an entire person?
“How was open mic night?” I ask, looking up, hoping to
lighten the mood and force him to give me that slow smile
of his. It's somewhat effective. The tension's still here, but
now so is that dimple. It's all I can do not to kiss it.
“Sydney and Chelsea drove everyone into the city,” he
says. “Abigail, Cameron, and Jessica did ‘The Raven.' They
got through the first nine stanzas. Jessica said she totally
screwed up, but I'm sure it didn't matter. It sounds like they
blew everyone away. Syd read something, too. They wanted
to perform their pieces for us today, but then you didn't
show up.”
He didn't go to open mic.
“You didn't go on Friday?”
“Um. No. How could I go after…” He catches himself and
changes course. “I couldn't go without you.”
“You should have gone,” I say plainly. And then I start to
panic, wondering what he said to the others. “You didn't tell
anyone…about me…did you?”
“What?” The question clearly catches him off guard. “Of
course not. I told them your car wouldn't start. That's why
we didn't make it to the city.”
We. Are we still “we”?
“Thanks. Please don't say anything, okay?”
He's watching me, waiting, I imagine, for an explanation
of some kind. And he deserves one. But I can't stand the
way he's looking at me right now, his eyes not only full of
questions but also full of pity. He didn't look at me this way
three days ago.
“Look, I want you to know everything,” I say, “but…it's
hard for me. I've never told anyone but Caro—” It starts to
slip off my lips and it's too late to take it back. I hope he
didn't hear me. But he did. It's all over his face.
“I've got to get to class,” I say as I push past him into the
crowd, head down, walking away as quickly as I can, and
kicking myself for saying her name.
By Tuesday afternoon, I've become pretty skilled at
sneaking around and avoiding people.
Kaitlyn and Alexis were heading my way between first
and second, and I started to panic, but then a group of guys
on the lacrosse team walked up to them, and that was all I
needed to creep by without them ever noticing me. Sydney
tried to talk with me after U.S. History, but I pretended I
didn't hear her and sped off for the pool. Olivia and I made
eye contact a few times during Trig, but I bolted for the door
as soon as the bell rang. I haven't seen Hailey since she
gave me my backpack yesterday morning.
Even though I'm avoiding all of them, I check my texts
obsessively. Five from Hailey, two from Alexis, and one from
Olivia, all saying pretty much the same thing:
you okay?
coming to lunch?
we're worried about you
sorry about Friday
we miss you
None from Kaitlyn.
And one from AJ:
I don't know what to say
I can't decide how to reply to any of them, so I don't.
I hang out in the bathroom near my fifth period class,
watching the time on my phone, and I head for the door
with less than a minute to spare. I've only taken two steps
into the corridor when I spot AJ standing a few feet away,
almost as if he's waiting for me.
He starts walking and there's nowhere to hide. Then he
stops, looming over me, blocking my way.
“You never read the poems in Caroline's Corner, did
you?”
I shake my head. I have no idea what that is.
He reaches for my hand and places the key inside my
open palm. Then he closes my fingers around the thick,
braided cord. “Go to the back right corner,” he says. He
walks away.
Caroline's Corner?
My legs are shaking and I feel light-headed as I open the
door to my classroom and slide into my desk. I stuff the key
under my leg so no one will see it. But during class, I hold it
in my hand, running my thumb back and forth over its sharp
edges and deep grooves, thinking about that room.
I'm not sure I can handle going downstairs all alone—I've
always been with the group or with Caroline. But then I
remember that's not true. Caroline didn't guide me that first
time. I followed them, but I was completely alone. I brought
myself down those stairs and into that room. That's when I
start to understand the connection.
The article I read last Friday night flashes in my mind.
“She loved writing poetry,” the quote from Caroline's mom
had said.
Caroline was a Poet.
After sixth, I don't hide in bathrooms or beeline straight
for my next class. Instead, I slowly make my way through
the crowd, keeping my head up, returning “hellos” and
“what's ups” from the people I pass, and walk to the theater
entrance. I've got such a tight grip on the key, I can feel the
notches leaving tiny impressions in my palm.
The theater isn't empty—a drama class is rehearsing a
play—but no one notices me climb the stairs, creep past the
grand piano, and slip behind the curtain. I open the narrow
door and close it quickly behind me, waiting to be sure no
one saw or followed me. Then I step down.
The air feels thicker and it smells dank, like dirty socks
and mold, but I breathe deeply and take it all in like I'm
experiencing it for the first time. I let my fingers skim the
dark gray walls as I walk down the hallway, feeling the
adrenaline pumping through my veins, recognizing how
terrified I am right now, and forcing myself to experience
every sensation, as if I need to prove to myself I can do this.
That I no longer need her help.
Inside the janitor's closet, I push the mops to one side,
and the door squeaks as I pull it toward me. I look around at
the black ceiling and the black floors and the black walls
that hardly look black because they're covered with so
many scraps of paper. The stool is where it always is. The
guitar stand is in the corner, but it's empty now. I flip the
closest lamp on, and then I lock myself inside.
I look around, taking everything in the way I always do. The
first time I was alone down here, I traversed the room,
stopping randomly to read, returning to the poems I liked
the most. I remember the sense of calm that washed over
me when I finally found the lyrics to AJ's song, and the joy I
felt as I read Sydney's fast-food wrappers. I spent hours
reading a decade's worth of poetry written by people who'd
graduated long ago. My eyes were burning from fatigue by
the time I sat on the couch and began writing something of
my own. When I left that day, I was in awe of every person
who'd ever stepped foot in Poet's Corner.
Now I take slow, measured steps toward the low
bookcase in the right corner and flip on the lamp so it
illuminates the wall. I never made it over here that first day,
and over the last few months, I don't recall planting any of
my own poetry here. If I had, I might have noticed what
made this spot so unique.
Unlike the other walls in Poet's Corner, everything here is
written on the same lined, three-hole-punched paper and
penned in the same handwriting—each letter perfectly
shaped, each word perfectly spaced.
Next to the lamp, I notice a wooden pencil box. I pick it
up, turning it over in my hands, running my fingertip over
the intricately carved swirls and waves. On the lid, I see
three letters: C.E.M.
I return the box to the bookcase and slowly peel it open.
The notebook paper inside looks rumpled, and with shaking
hands, I remove it from its home and unfold it along the
creases. It's not a poem. It's a letter. My breath catches
deep in my throat when I realize it's written in the exact
same handwriting I see on the wall in front of me.
Dear Mr. B—
You're going to think that what I did was your fault. It
wasn't. And this room didn't do anything wrong. In
fact, it saved my life for a long time.
You created a place for me to go and helped me fill it
with words and people I could trust. It was the kindest,
most generous thing anyone has ever done for me.
When I was inside this room, I was happy.
If I could have captured how I felt on Mondays and
Thursdays, and carried it around in my pocket for later
use, I would have. Believe me, I tried.
You don't owe me anything more. But I hope you'll
consider honoring this last request.
Words are beginning to gather here. Just think of what
these walls could look like if everyone who needed
this room found it. Can you picture it? I can.
Here's my key. Pass it on?
Love,
C
My hand instinctively goes to the cord around my neck,
and I squeeze it in my fist.
Caroline's Corner.
That's why Mr. B leaves the theater door open when AJ
asks him to. Why he keeps this room a secret. Why he pops
in every once in a while to vacuum and empty the trash.
He knew Caroline. He built out this room for her, hid the
door, and camouflaged the lock to keep it a secret. She
asked him to pass the key along, and he honored her last
wish. He's been doing it ever since she died.
Still gripping her letter in one hand, I grab the edge of
the bookcase with the other. My knees aren't feeling too
stable right now.
Caroline Madsen started Poet's Corner.
I take a step closer and brush my hand along the pages,
as if I'm introducing myself for the first time.
These are her poems.
I read the titles and skim over the first lines, but some of
them are placed too high and I can't see the words from
here. I walk to the front of the room, grab the stool from the
stage, and bring it back to the corner, standing on top of it
so I can get a closer look.
On the highest point of the wall, I spot a poem titled
“Insecurity,” and I read it to myself. Then I move to the next
one, called “Alone in the Dark.” And the next one, which is
untitled, but begins with the words, “Alliteration is
alarmingly addictive.”
They're beautiful and hilarious, and the more I read, the
more I cry and the harder I laugh. But something doesn't
feel right, and it's not until I'm halfway through her fourth
poem that I realize what it is.
I start reading aloud.
As I begin reading her fifth poem, I arch my back and
square my shoulders, standing taller, reading louder and
stronger and clearer, and it feels good to speak her words—
to listen to them come to life again—even if there's no one
else around to hear how incredible they are. I read the rest
of them the same way, in a loud, booming, confident voice,
the way I imagine she would have wanted it.
I've read more than fifty poems, and finally, there's only
one left. It's placed low on the wall, closest to the wooden
pencil box, and there's something about the way it's
mounted, with the black paint still exposed, acting like a
thin frame, that makes me wonder if it's special somehow.
It's called “Every Last Word.” I read to myself this time.
These walls heard
me when no
one else could.
They gave my
words a home,
kept them safe.
Cheered, cried, listened.
Changed my life
for the better.
It wasn't enough.
But they heard
every last word.
I cover my mouth, tears streaming down my face. It's
written in threes.
I read it again, out loud this time, even though my voice
cracks and I have to stop after every other line to catch my
breath. Sometimes I stop because I want to let the meaning
of a word or phrase sink deep into my skin. But I keep going,
crying harder as I read that final line.
This was her last poem.
And I realize that Caroline did bring me here, in her own
strange way, to these people, to this room, knowing how
much I needed this place.
This room changed her life. And it's just beginning to
change mine.
I picture Sydney, sitting alone in fast-food restaurants,
writing the funny things she reads to us and the deeper
thoughts she never shares. And Chelsea, writing poem after
poem about the guy who broke her heart. Emily, sitting at
her mom's bedside, watching her slip away and trying to
hold her here a little longer. AJ propped up against his bed,
playing his guitar and trying to find the perfect words to
match the notes. Cameron, watching his parents fall apart
and trying not to do the same himself. Jessica and her
booming voice in a tiny body, full of contagious confidence.
And Abigail, whose poems are deep and astute, who had me
at “As if.” Now that I know her better, her poetry no longer
surprises me.
They're my friends. And I realize I know a whole lot more
about them than they know about me.
My next step is so clear. I leap off the chair and head for
my backpack, feeling inspired to write for the first time in
four days. I reach inside for my yellow notebook, because
when Caroline was part of my life, she made me stronger,
better, and happier. And that's the part of myself I need to
reconnect with right now.
I sit on the orange couch with my feet folded underneath
me. The pen feels solid in my hand, and when I bring it to
the paper, I'm relieved to feel the words flowing out like
someone turned on the spigot.
And before I know it, I've filled the page with a poem for
Caroline. It voices what she means to me and how much I
miss her and why this room of hers matters, not just to me
but to everyone who's ever found it. And, while it doesn't
say it in so many words, it's also a poem for my new friends,
promising that from now on I'll be a lot braver with my
words than I was before.
I close my notebook, and for the first time since Friday
afternoon, I smile. It feels good. As I gather my things, I
check the time on my phone. It's 4:18. I've been down here
for more than two hours.
Before I leave, I walk to the closest wall and run my hand
along the brown paper bags and candy wrappers, the
ripped-up scraps of paper and Post-it notes, the napkins and
receipts, thinking about all the people who have spent time
in this room. Every person with a poem on this wall has a
story to tell.
I need to know more.
I feel that familiar swirl start to build inside me, that
craving for information, and more information. My breathing
speeds up and my fingers start tingling. I want to know
every single person's story, and I start to feel excited by the
idea of researching each one until I've pieced it all together.
And then the swirl stops, as quickly as it started.
I don't need to know hundreds of stories. I only need to
know seven.
I've never asked any of them to tell me how they found
Poet's Corner. I never asked Caroline. I never even asked AJ.
AJ.
I flip off the last light and race back up the stairs and into
the student lot. My mind needs music, and I start to turn on
In the Deep, but then I spot Grab the Yoke and choose it
instead.
I think about that day I first drove around with AJ, telling
him how I named my playlists. He asked about this one. I
told him how I sometimes wanted to “fly the whole mess
into the sea,” and when I said the words, he looked at me
like he was worried I might actually do it. Did my words
remind him of Caroline, the founder of his beloved poetry
club? She grabbed the yoke.
My mind is on overload and my stomach is in knots as I
throw the car in reverse, peel out of the student lot, and
make the turns that lead to AJ's house. At the top of his
driveway, I pull the emergency brake hard and scramble out
of my car.
The wind is picking up, whistling through the trees and
stinging my cheeks, and I tighten my jacket around my body
as I climb the stairs. I start to knock, but then I hear AJ's
guitar coming from the other side of the door. It's too faint
to make out the song, but I can picture him with his fingers
pressed into the strings, forming chords, sliding up and
down along the neck. I knock before I lose my nerve.
The music stops, and few seconds later, he opens the
door. “Hi.” He looks surprised to see me.
“Hi.” I lift the cord over my head and hand it to him.
“Thank you,” I say. He stuffs it into the pocket of his jeans. I
look down at my shoes.
We're both silent for a long time, me trying to muster up
the courage to say what I came here to say, and him
probably trying to figure out the fastest way to get a
psychotic girl off one's porch.
I stand up straighter, cementing my feet in place and
looking right at him. “I found her corner.” I bite my lip to
keep my chin from trembling. “I was kind of hoping you'd
tell me more about her. More about that room and how you
found it, and how you got the key.”
He opens the door wider. “Come in. You're freezing.”
Nope. Just terrified.
I haven't been inside his house since that day I drove him
home, when he taught me how to play guitar and I learned
all about Devon. I step inside and drop my car keys on the
entry table where I left them last time.
And that's when it hits me. I jumped out of the car
without checking the odometer. For a split second, I
consider going back outside, but AJ is already walking
toward his room. He looks over his shoulder, sees me
hesitating, and gestures for me to follow him.
I force myself to walk down the hallway, trying to think
about him and nothing else, ignoring the intense urge I'm
feeling to sprint back to the car and park correctly.
Last time, when he closed the door behind us, I didn't
know where to go or what to do, but this time, I walk
straight to his bed and sit on the edge. I'm relieved when he
sits next to me. He leans back on his hands, looking serious.
Or maybe he's still freaked out, I can't really tell.
“What do you want to know?” he asks.
I take a deep breath and blow it out slowly. “Everything,”
I say.
The small smile that forms on his lips makes me relax a
bit.
“Mr. B told me the whole story when he gave me the key
at the end of last year. He met Caroline when she was a
sophomore. One day during lunch, he opened the door to
the storage room next to the cafeteria, and found her hiding
in there, all alone. It took some doing, but eventually she
admitted it wasn't the first time; she had been eating there
every day since the middle of her freshman year.”
I picture her in one of her funny T-shirts, eating a
sandwich while nestled among mop buckets and dustpans,
and I want to cry. Or punch something. Possibly both at the
same time.
“I guess people were mean to her. She told him she
didn't have any friends, and she was too embarrassed to eat
alone in the quad, so she ate alone in the storage closet
because she couldn't think of anyplace else to go.”
My heart sinks deep in my chest. I remember saying
almost the same thing to Shrink-Sue at the beginning of the
school year. She asked why I wouldn't leave the Crazy
Eights. I said I didn't have anywhere else to go.
“Caroline and Mr. B became friends. He started bringing
his lunch and joining her. At some point, she told him about
her poems, and eventually she let him read some of them.
She told him about this crazy idea she'd had to start a
secret poetry club.
“Mr. B didn't think it was so crazy. He showed her a room
underneath the theater that the drama department hadn't
used in years. He installed the lock, hid the seams with
paint, and moved some furniture inside. Caroline started
filling one corner with her poetry. Over time, she met a few
people she felt she could trust. She told them about the
room, and by the end of the year, the other walls were filling
up, too. I guess she wasn't the only one who needed a place
to go.”
I came over to AJ's house today because I needed to
know what brought him to Poet's Corner, and when he says
that last part, things begin to fall into place. My eyes well
up.
“You needed a place to go,” I say, and he nods.
“Emily and I had freshman English together. It was still
really hard for me to talk in class, and she caught me doing
my strumming-on-my-jeans thing. She asked me about it.
Eventually, she brought me downstairs.”
“AJ,” I whisper. I wipe my eyes, but all I really want to do
right now is throw my arms around his neck and kiss him
like I've done so many times over the last few weeks. But
I'm so afraid of what will happen if I do. Will he push me
away? Will he tell me it's over? I don't want to lose him, and
I can't tell if I already have. I wish he'd touch me. My heart
starts racing, my hands feel clammy, the thoughts are
gathering and swirling, and I start panicking.
Why won't he touch me?
And then, as quickly as they began, the thoughts stop.
Completely. Inside my head it's eerily quiet. And I know
what I need to do.
Caroline's been giving me words, and they've worked.
But they were never her words. They were always mine. My
words got AJ to let me into Poet's Corner, both times. When I
told him how I name my playlists, he paid attention and
wanted to know more. When we were at the pool that night,
he begged me to talk to him. When I finally told him what I
was thinking, he kissed me. Every time I talk to him, he
comes closer.
He wants me to talk to him.
And suddenly, I hear Caroline's voice, calm and clear, as
if she were sitting right next to me.
Don't think. Go.
I look over my left shoulder, expecting to see her there,
but the space is empty. I follow her instructions anyway.
“My mind messes with me,” I say, talking in that
unfiltered way he likes, not measuring my words and not
quite certain about what's coming out until I hear myself
say it. I scratch the back of my neck hard three times, no
longer caring if he notices. “It's been happening as long as I
can remember. I can't turn off my thoughts. I can't sleep
without being drugged into it. My mind just…never stops
working.
“I was diagnosed with OCD when I was eleven. I've been
on antianxiety medication ever since. I have this amazing
psychiatrist named Sue who is, like, my lifeline, and I see
her every Wednesday afternoon.”
This is harder than I expected. I take a moment to gather
my thoughts, looking around at his posters and his messy
desk. I see his clipboard on the floor next to his guitar, and
together, they seem to calm me. I shake out my hands.
“For a long time, my friendship with the Eights has
been…challenging for me. So when school started, Sue and I
decided to channel my energy into positive things, like my
swimming,” I say. “That's been good. Then I met Caroline,
and that was really good. And then I found Poet's Corner,
and started writing poetry, and met a bunch of amazing
people, and then there was you. And I felt healthy for the
first time in years. I thought I was getting better. But as it
turns out, I was getting worse.”
I study his body language like I do with Sue each week,
watching the way he moves in direct correlation to the
words I say. It's slight, almost imperceptible, but I notice
when he props his hand on his bed and leans in a tiny bit
closer to me.
Let your guard down.
“Caroline was my friend,” I say as the tears slide down
my cheeks. “And now she's gone and I can't quite decide
how I'm supposed to feel about that. I'm embarrassed that I
made her up in the first place, but I'm also so sad that she's
not part of my life anymore.”
Keep talking.
“But when I was downstairs this afternoon, I realized
something: I don't regret bringing her to life. Not even for a
second. Because she's this better part of me, you know?
She speaks her mind and she doesn't care what people
think about her. I've always been too scared to be that
person, but that's who I want to be, all the time, not only
when I'm alone with you, and not just on Monday and
Thursday afternoons during lunch.”
I can tell I'm rambling, but I can't stop now. I'm letting
the words tumble out of my mouth, still wishing he'd touch
me, hug me, kiss me, do something—anything—to make me
stop talking. But he doesn't speak and he doesn't move. He
just listens.
“It was as if she knew it was time for me to tap into this
better person. So she showed me where to find you. All of
you. These seven amazing people who seem to know how to
pull her out of me.”
“Sam,” he says, and before I can interpret the tone in his
voice, he closes the distance, and finally, I feel his thumbs
on my cheeks. He rests his forehead against mine, just like
he did that night in the pool, and I wait for him to kiss me,
but he doesn't.
Keep going.
“I'm sorry I didn't tell you about me. I should have, but
all my life, I've just wanted to be normal. You made me feel
like I was. I was afraid that if I told you, I wouldn't feel
normal anymore.”
He laughs. “I made you feel normal? You do realize I'm
pretty far from normal, right?”
“I don't care,” I say, brushing my lips against his. “I like
you too much. Remember?”
I kiss his dimple first, and then I cover his mouth with
mine, kissing him, thinking about how perfect he is, maybe
not in every way, but in every way I need him to be. And I'm
so relieved when he kisses me back. I feel the thoughts that
have haunted me for the last four days pop like bubbles,
disappearing into the air, one by one.
“I like you too much, too,” he says.
“Still?” I ask.
“Still,” he says with a huge smile on his face. “Way, way
too much.”
After that, we stop talking.
Emily pats the spot next to her and I sit down. I steal a
quick glimpse over my shoulder at the couch Caroline and I
sat on during the P.M. last Thursday night, but I don't expect
her to be there. Cameron's got the whole thing to himself
today.
“We missed you on Monday,” she says. “Everything
okay?”
“Yeah.” I see AJ taking his usual seat on the orange
couch. He catches me looking at him. “It wasn't, but it is
now.” I reach down for my yellow notebook and set it on the
cushion next to me. Emily's holding a napkin in her hand,
presumably for today's reading.
“How's your mom?” I ask.
She doesn't look at me. “She came home last weekend.”
“That's great,” I say enthusiastically. But Emily shakes
her head as she twists the napkin around one finger.
“Hospice,” she says, and I feel a pit form deep in my
stomach.
“Oh, Emily. I'm so sorry.”
“My dad made it sound like a big event, as if her coming
home was a good thing, but, come on…Like I don't know
what fucking hospice is?” She tucks one leg under the other
and turns toward me. “The entire living room has been
transformed and now it looks nothing like the one she
decorated, and there are machines everywhere, and that
horrible bed is smack in the middle of the window, like she's
on display for the whole neighborhood or something. But
‘it's a good thing,' right?” she says sarcastically. “Because
now she can see our front yard during the day.”
Emily rests her elbow on the back of the couch, props her
head in her hand, and keeps talking. “I pretended to be
happy because I knew it meant a lot to my dad, but now
coming home from school every day is absolute torture.” As
soon as she says it, her eyes grow wide and her whole face
turns bright red. She covers her mouth. “That sounded so
horrible. I shouldn't have said that.”
I picture that cute house she lives in with the cheery
paint and the rope swing, knowing that's what her mom is
staring at all day, and I can't imagine how excruciating it
must be for Emily to walk through that blue door and see
her mom lying there, slowly dying.
Emily turns away from me, shaking her head in disgust.
“Jesus. What kind of person says that about her own
mother?”
I've said those same what-kind-of-person words myself.
They're especially damaging, the kind of thing that can
make a thought-spiral tornado unexpectedly change course,
shifting into an entirely new and even more destructive
direction. My mom and Sue always have words that help, so
I say them to Emily.
“A good person,” I tell her. She catches my eye and gives
me a trace of a smile. “Someone who loves her mom and
doesn't want to see her in so much pain.”
She blows out a big breath like she's air-drying her face.
“Thank you,” she whispers toward the ceiling.
The idea comes out of nowhere, and before I give it a
second thought, I start blurting. “Come over to my house
after school today. We can talk. Or write. Or listen to music,
and not talk, and not write, and not think about anything
bad at all.”
“I don't know,” she says, looking down at the floor,
picking at her fingernails. “My dad likes me to come straight
home after school.”
I point at the phone next to her hip, screen facing up like
it always is. “He'll call if he needs you. I can have you there
in ten minutes.” Emily looks like she's considering it. “You
can even stay for dinner if you want to. My mom's a horrible
cook, so you'll have to pretend to like the food, but my dad
is, like, the king of small talk, and my little sister can be kind
of funny.”
I force myself to shut up because I can't tell if all this
family talk is making Emily feel better or worse. But then
she looks over at me and says, “That sounds nice and…”
She pauses for a moment, as if she's searching for the right
word. “Normal.”
Normal.
She's right. It does sound normal. My life might not be
perfect and my brain might play tricks on me and I might be
overwhelmed by my own thoughts, but now that I think
about it, I'm lucky to have as much normal as I do.
I look at Emily, wondering if I could do for her what
Caroline did for me. Wondering if I could pay it forward.
I'll gauge it, but if she comes over today and it seems like
she wants to talk, I'll ask her questions and listen—really
listen, like Caroline listened to me—and keep her talking
until she has nothing left to say. If she wants to, I'll help her
write a happy poem about her mom. Something positive.
Something she can read to her. And if the moment feels
right and she wants a change of subject, I'll tell her my
secrets. I'll let her in on my OCD and Shrink-Sue and
Caroline and the number three, and I'll talk until she knows
everything.
Does she see it in my eyes right now, how much I want to
be her friend? Because something shifts in her expression
and her whole face lights up, more than I've ever seen it do
before. “Actually, I'd love that,” she says.
“Okay, who's up first?” AJ asks from his spot in the front
of the room.
I look around. Sydney's got a wrapper in her hands, but
aside from doing a little dance in her seat, she doesn't
move. Emily is still holding her napkin, but she doesn't look
ready to go yet. Jessica and Cameron are holding papers in
their hands too, but they don't stand up and head for the
stage either.
“I'll go,” I say, and before I can think too much about it,
I'm standing up, walking to the stage, sitting on the stool. I
open my notebook to the right page. “I wrote this on
Tuesday in—”
As soon as I speak, my mouth goes dry. I take a deep
breath, close my notebook on my lap, and look out into the
group, letting my gaze settle on each one of them. I
remember the first time I sat up here, staring at these total
strangers, feeling terrified about how much of myself I was
about to expose.
Things are different now.
“I went through something last weekend,” I say. “And it
made me realize it was no mistake that I wandered down
here one day and found all of you. So before I read this
poem, I just want to say thank you for letting me stay, even
though I probably didn't deserve it and some of you didn't
think I belonged.”
My notebook is still closed on my lap. I don't open it. I
don't need to. I know these words by heart.
“I wrote this in Poet's Corner.”
I bring my left hand to my shoulder, exactly where
Caroline's was the first time I sat on this stool and read
aloud. My eyes fall shut.
You're still here
stitched into me, like threads in a sweater.
Feeding me words
that break me down and piece me back together, all at
once.
Tightening your grip,
reminding me that I'm not alone.
I never was.
None of us ever are.
You are still here
stitched into the words on these walls.
Every last one.
The room is completely silent. Then everyone starts
clapping and whistling, and I open my eyes to find AJ
standing up, glue stick ready to launch. I give him one of his
trademark chin tilts and he sends it flying. I catch it in
midair.
It feels good to rip this poem out of the notebook, and
even better to cover the paper with glue. I march to the
back of the room, and I find a sliver of empty space on the
wall near the hidden door. “Thank you, Caroline,” I whisper
as I bring the page to my lips. Then I press it against the
wall, running my hand over the words, securing them in
place.
Back on stage, Sydney clears her throat dramatically.
“Most of you have already heard this tasty treat, but since
some of you missed it because you were dealing with ‘car
trouble,'” she says with air quotes, locking eyes with AJ,
then with me. “I thought I'd read it again.”
I sit next to AJ this time, and he wraps his arms around
my waist. I recline against his chest and he rests his chin on
my shoulder.
Sydney unfolds a paper In-N-Out hat and positions it on
her head. Then she launches into a dramatic reading about
the secret menu. She praises the Flying Dutchman and the
2x4, makes us hungry with her descriptions of special
sauces and spices and grilled onions, and leaves us
mystified about the people who order “cold cheese.” When
she finishes her poem, she passes out paper In-N-Out hats
to all of us.
We're all still wearing them as we file out the door.
Everyone heads into the hallway, but AJ hangs back.
“What's the matter?” I ask him.
“Your call, but I'm wondering if that poem of yours is in
the right home.” He hands me a glue stick.
He has a point.
I step back inside, remove the page from the wall, and
apply a fresh coat of glue to the back. Then I walk over to
Caroline's Corner and find a new spot, right next to her
collection.
“Much better,” he says as he anchors my hat on my
head.
AJ grabs my hand and leads me up the stairs, back into
the real world.
My legs feel wobbly and I'm sure everyone is staring at me
as I cross the cafeteria. Alexis and Kaitlyn are on one side of
the table; Hailey and Olivia are on the other.
Alexis sees me first. She elbows Kaitlyn and whispers
something in her ear. I keep taking brave steps across the
room, Sue's voice in my head, reminding me to hold on to
the people who make me stronger and better, and let go of
the ones who don't. Holding on to the Poets was easy.
Letting go of the Eights is already proving to be harder than
I expected.
“Can I talk to you guys?” I'm asking all of them, but for
some reason, I direct the question to Alexis.
“Of course,” she replies, scooting down, making room
next to her. “Where have you been? We haven't seen you all
week.”
“We were worried,” Kaitlyn says. I must look skeptical
because she adds, “Really. We were. In fact, I went to your
locker a bunch of times looking for you.”
“Why?” I ask.
“I wanted to apologize.”
I'm still not sure I believe her. If she wanted to apologize
so badly, she could have tried a lot harder to find me. She
hasn't texted me once in seven days.
I catch Hailey giving her a stern look. Kaitlyn sits up
straighter and leans in closer to me. “I'm glad you're here,
because I've been meaning to talk to you. What I said last
week wasn't funny. I was out of line and I'm sorry. I hope
you'll accept my apology, Sam.”
Wait. Did she call me Sam?
I look at Hailey's smug expression, thinking about the
conversation we had in my room last Sunday, and I start to
realize what's happening. Hailey's been rallying for me from
the inside. She doesn't want me to leave. She's convinced
them to apologize and start calling me Sam from now on.
Then this will all be over. And everything can go back to the
way it was.
Am I really such a great friend that they can't stand to
lose me? Or are they merely trying to save face? I'd like to
think it's the former—that I've been overreacting all these
years and they really are true friends who love me for
exactly who I am—but I'm not completely sure.
Kaitlyn takes a sip of her soda, and then turns to Alexis.
“Did you tell her about this weekend?”
Alexis looks around to be sure no one can hear her, and
then she rests her forearms on the table and lowers her
voice. “My parents are going out of town. I can't have
another party, because if they catch me again, they'll take
my car away. So we're keeping it small.”
“All the guys are coming over,” Olivia pipes in, pointing
around the cafeteria as she identifies them. “Travis, Jeremy,
Kurt…We still need someone for Hailey. And you can bring
AJ, okay? So we can get to know him better.”
I'm tempted. I don't want to be, but I am. I've been
mentally preparing myself to part ways with the Eights all
week, but now I'm not so sure I want to leave them behind
so completely.
Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I can have both. Now that I
think about it, AJ might like being pulled into my circle. I've
never even asked him. I picture all of us sitting around
Alexis's living room, talking late into the night, everyone
getting to know the side of AJ most people don't get to see
and…Wait. What did Olivia just say?
I turn back to Kaitlyn. “You're seeing Kurt?” For a split
second, she looks a little embarrassed, but she quickly
recovers. She cocks her head to one side. “Yeah. We sort of
bumped into each other at a party last weekend and got
back together.”
Got back together? I'd hardly call making out with my
boyfriend in a coat-check room while I was fifty feet away
“together.” But I'm glad she told me. For a minute, I almost
forgot why I came over here today.
“I need to say something to you guys.” The mood shifts
instantly. Alexis folds her arms across her chest. Kaitlyn
stares at me, eyebrows raised. Olivia bites her lip and fixes
her gaze on the table. Hailey brings her hand to her
forehead.
“We've been best friends since we were little kids, and
there are so many reasons for that. We've always had so
much fun together. All of my very best memories include
you guys.” I'm speaking slowly and clearly, exactly the way
Sue coached me. I feel my hands shaking, but I take a deep
breath and keep talking. “But we've also changed a lot over
the years. And I think that's a good thing. I think we're
supposed to change, and when we do, that has to be okay.
I've changed over the last few months, and I like the person
I'm becoming.”
“And who is that?” Olivia asks.
“That's the thing,” I say with a shrug. “I'm not sure. The
truth is, I don't really know who I am without you guys. But I
think I need to find out.”
It doesn't come out exactly the way Sue and I practiced,
but it's close and I followed all the rules. I intentionally don't
mention AJ or any of my other friends downstairs, and I'm
careful with my words so they don't think I'm blaming them
or anything. We're growing apart. It's time to part ways.
“Did your new boyfriend put you up to this?” Olivia asks.
“He sounds a little possessive,” Kaitlyn says to her, as if
I'm not sitting right here.
“Stop it,” Hailey interjects. “Now.” I feel her hand on my
shoulder and it catches me completely off guard. “I'm not
doing this. Not again.”
I know what she means. We all do. She's not going to let
them treat me the way we all treated Sarah. And I realize
that no matter what happens today, Hailey now knows
which side she's on, and it's mine.
“She's right,” Alexis says. “You're our friend. We love
you. You should do what makes you happy.”
Kaitlyn raises her eyebrows. Olivia won't look at me.
Hailey still has her hand on my shoulder. Alexis is smiling at
me, and it looks genuine.
I'm still trying to get my head around this whole thing.
I'm having a hard time believing those words just came out
of Alexis's mouth, but she sounds sincere. Maybe it's a
game. Maybe I'm about to be the punch line of some big
joke, or the focal point of some nasty piece of gossip. Even if
I am, I can't do anything about it anyway.
I give Hailey's hand a grateful squeeze as I stand up.
“I'll see you guys later.” I walk through the cafeteria
doors, leaving my friends behind. Feeling all the pain of
letting them go. And knowing I did the right thing.
“How are you today, Sam?” Colleen stands up from
behind the counter as I open the door.
She used to practically sing her “It must be Wednesday”
line, but today, I get the same awkward greeting I got last
week, her voice dropping into a lower octave when she says
my name, her lips pursed sympathetically while she waits
for my reply. I tell her I'm fine.
I've already apologized for bursting in here that day, and
she insisted I had nothing to be sorry for. That she'd already
forgotten all about it. Clearly, she hasn't.
“She's waiting for you. Go on in.”
I was kind of hoping Sue would suggest moving our
meeting to her backyard oasis, where we could talk in
comfortable chairs around a fountain and among flowers,
but no such luck.
When I step into her office, she stands up from behind
her desk and crosses the room to meet me halfway. “Wow.
You look different today,” she says, beaming at me.
“Do I?” I ask, like I don't know what she's talking about.
But I do. I'm wearing jeans and a plain, long-sleeve T-shirt.
My hair is long and straight, but I didn't flat iron it or
anything. And I'm hardly wearing any makeup, just a light
bit of foundation, some blush, and mascara. I've been
scaling back over the last few weeks. This feels more like
me. And I have an extra hour to sleep now.
“If it weren't for the holiday decorations all over town
and the fact that I have to cook Christmas dinner for twenty
people next week, I'd swear it was the middle of July,” she
says. “You look relaxed. And happy. Like Summer Sam.”
I'm not sure how to explain it, but I don't feel like
Summer Sam. I'm more relaxed, happier than she ever was,
because even in July I was dreading August, and finding it
hard to be truly happy when the sand was flowing into the
bottom half of the hourglass and there was nothing I could
do to stop it.
“Summer Sam was always…” I pause, searching for the
right word, and settle on: “Temporary. But this feels pretty
permanent.”
Sue smiles.
“I registered for the advanced swim program today. Five
a.m. practices every morning.” I roll my eyes. “But yearround
meets, a chance to swim at Junior Nationals, and a
much better shot at a scholarship.”
Now she's beaming. “Well, that's certainly cause for
celebration.” Sue glides over to the minifridge and removes
a bottle of sparkling apple cider. She pours it into two plastic
champagne flutes and returns, handing one to me.
“To Sam,” she says, raising her glass in the air.
I clink mine against it and echo her words. “To Sam.”
We take our ciders over to our chairs. I kick off my shoes
and Sue hands me my putty. I take sips from my glass as I
fill her in on my week, and she listens and nods. She doesn't
have her leather-bound portfolio on her lap like she usually
does, so I have a feeling this is going to be a light session.
After the last few, I imagine we could both use one.
Three weeks ago, we spent the entire time role-playing
my breakup with the Crazy Eights. The week after that, I
spent the whole time crying, wondering if I'd made the right
decision. Last week, we switched gears, and Sue convinced
me to recite the poem I wrote for Caroline. And then she
asked me to read more of my poems, and I cried even
harder.
As I was reading, I started to realize how much the
number three has been impacting my thoughts and actions,
and by the end of our session, I told her I wanted to work
harder to control my impulses. Which meant I had to fess up
about the odometer.
Sue pointed to the putty in my hands. “What if you took
a chunk of that with you today and used it to cover the
numbers?” I'd squeezed it in between my fingers and told
her that might work. “If you feel like you truly need to
remove it before you park, go ahead,” she says. “Then put it
back. But see if you can keep it on there for good.”
I still think about those numbers every time I park, but I
haven't cheated once.
We talk about AJ next. I fill her in on everything, and then
I tell her he drove me to my appointment today.
“He needed some new guitar strings, and the music store
is a couple blocks away.” I take a sip of my sparkling cider,
thinking about how the whole conversation with AJ played
out.
We've talked a lot about Sue over the last few weeks. He
knows how important she is to me, and that I want him to
meet her someday. I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet, but I
liked the idea of him dropping me off. I told him he could
meet Colleen if he wanted to.
“I kind of needed him to see where I go on Wednesdays.”
I can tell she's proud of me. I'm feeling a little proud of
myself, too. It feels good to talk. It feels good to be
surrounded by people who make it so easy.
And then she asks me about Caroline, and I get quiet for
a long time.
Finally, I tell her how my stomach falls every time I look
at the other end of my locker bank and find it empty, and
how I often sit in the first row of the theater during lunch,
writing in the dark like the two of us used to do. I admit that
last week, I started making a playlist of songs that were
popular during Caroline's high school years and titled it
Right Beside You after the lyrics in a Snow Patrol song.
“I miss her. A lot. Every day.” The lump in my throat
swells and I can feel my eyes welling up. I don't want to cry.
Not today.
Sue must be able to tell from the look on my face,
because she stands and claps her hands together once.
“Hey,” she says excitedly. “I have something for you.”
She walks over to her desk and returns carrying a box
wrapped in bright blue paper with a big white bow around
the center. She hands it to me.
“You got me a Christmas present? Let me guess. A shiny
new brain? A healthy one this time?” I give it a little shake.
Damn. Too light.
“It's just a little something. I couldn't resist. It spoke to
me—said you two needed each other.”
“Hey, if I can talk to imaginary people, I guess you can
talk to inanimate objects.” I tug at the bow and it falls to the
floor. I pull the lid off the box. “No way,” I say. I hold the Tshirt
up in front of me so I can read the big block letters: I AM
SILENTLY CORRECTING YOUR GRAMMAR.
“Sue, this is awesome. It's so…” I stop short of saying the
first thing that pops into my head. Then I say it anyway.
“Caroline.”
I stand up and hug her, even though I'm not supposed to,
and she hugs me back, despite the fact that we're breaking
her “professional distance” code. I layer my new shirt over
the top of my long-sleeved tee and model it for her. “What
do you think?” I ask.
“Perfect,” she says.
No. It's not perfect. But it's me.
When our time is up, I leave her office and head back to
the waiting room, realizing that, for the first time in five
years, we didn't talk about the Crazy Eights.
AJ had said he'd meet me downstairs, so I'm surprised to
find him in the waiting room. “Hey,” he says. “Nice shirt.”
“Thanks. It was a gift from Sue.” I point to Colleen. “Did
you two meet?”
“We did,” she says. She's no longer wearing that pitystare.
She's looking at us with the glowing, giddy expression
I'm more accustomed to.
“See you next Wednesday,” I tell her.
AJ and I walk out the doors and stop in front of the
elevators, and once we're out of Sue's office and away from
Colleen's curious eyes, he wraps his arms around me. I feel
his fingers in my hair and his breath on my neck, and he
doesn't say a word, he just hugs me tight for the longest
time. I love the way I fit in his arms. How my ear rests
perfectly against his chest and I can hear his heartbeat.
“Thanks for coming today,” I tell him.
“I'm glad I did.”
“Me too.”
I reach out and press the elevator button. Once. I feel the
urge to push it two more times, but I grab AJ's hand and kiss
it instead.
It's pouring outside. AJ, Cameron, Chelsea, Jessica, Sydney,
and I are gathered around a table in the cafeteria. Emily
would be here, but her mom lost her long battle with cancer,
and she hasn't been at school since we returned from winter
break. The funeral is tomorrow and Emily asked AJ to play
one of her mom's favorite songs. We'll all be there, of
course.
I glance over at the spot where I used to sit. Alexis,
Kaitlyn, Olivia, and Hailey are all where they belong, eating
and chatting as usual. We haven't said much to each other
in the last month, but they all look happy, even Hailey.
AJ rests his hand on my knee. “You all right?”
“Yeah.” I push my food around my plate. “I'm not very
hungry today.” I pull my phone out of my pocket and check
the time. We still have another thirty minutes before lunch
is over. “I think I'll go write for a bit.”
“Have fun,” he says, giving my leg a squeeze.
I stand up, grabbing my tray off the table and telling
everyone I'll see them later. Before I leave, I wrap my free
arm around AJ's neck from behind. “Love you,” I whisper in
his ear.
The rain is coming down harder, which doesn't matter
that much until the covered walkway comes to an end and
there's no other way to get to the theater's double doors
than to cross the open grass. I throw my jacket over my
head and make a run for it.
Once I'm inside, I toss my jacket over a chair in the back
row and walk down the aisle to the front of the theater. I sit
in the chair I always sit in, open my yellow notebook to an
empty page, and fish around in the bottom of my backpack
until I find a mechanical pencil. I click it once, twice, three
times. And then I hear Shrink-Sue's voice in my head, telling
me to click it again, so I give it a fourth click. I stop, resisting
the urge to click it two more times.
I scoot back into the chair and slide down low, kicking my
legs out in front of me, crossing them at the ankles, staring
up at the ceiling and trying to decide where to start. I tap
the eraser against the paper. I'm at a loss. I close my eyes
and sit like that for a few minutes, breathing in the musky
smell of this room, running my fingernails back and forth
across the upholstery. I never expected to feel a connection
to this place, and now, sometimes it's the only place I want
to be.
It's been a tough week. I can't stop thinking about Emily.
I want to write a poem for her, something that expresses
how sorry I am and tells her how much her friendship means
to me, but the words aren't coming today. I let out a groan
and look down at my feet.
I see a pair of boots, right next to my shoes. Then legs,
crossed at the ankles, mirroring my posture exactly. My gaze
travels up slowly, carefully, like I'm afraid any sudden
movement will cause me to lose her.
When I reach her face, I suck in a breath. Then I give her
the biggest smile.
“Hey. I'm glad you're here,” I say, tapping the page with
my pencil. “I could use your help with this.”
Her head falls to the side and she smiles back at me.
“Anytime,” she says as she reaches over and takes my hand
in hers.
I want to keep looking at her, but instead, I let my eyes
fall shut.
“Actually,” I whisper, “I think I've got this one.”
When I open my eyes again, Caroline is gone.
And I start filling the page with words.
